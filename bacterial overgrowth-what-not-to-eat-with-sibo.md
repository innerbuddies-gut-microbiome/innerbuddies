Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) occurs when bacteria that normally reside in the colon colonize and multiply in the small intestine, producing excess gas, bloating, pain, and nutrient malabsorption. Dietary adjustments are a foundational part of symptom management because certain foods provide fuel for these bacteria or impair gut motility.

One practical resource for dietary guidance is [what not to eat with SIBO](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/what-not-to-eat-with-sibo). In parallel, microbiome analysis and focused lifestyle changes can refine choices for individual patients.

Foods and ingredients commonly associated with worse SIBO symptoms

- High-FODMAP carbohydrates: Fructans (onion, garlic, wheat), lactose (milk, soft cheeses), excess fructose (some fruits), and polyols (sorbitol, xylitol) are rapidly fermented in the small bowel and often provoke bloating and gas.
- Refined sugars and simple carbohydrates: These are fast substrates for gas-producing species and can exacerbate dysbiosis.
- Processed foods and additives: Emulsifiers, certain preservatives, and ultra-processed products may alter the mucosal barrier and microbiota composition.
- Sugar alcohols and artificial sweeteners: Polyols and some non-nutritive sweeteners can change gut microbiome composition and increase fermentation symptoms.
- Alcohol and high-sugar beverages: These can increase gut permeability and feed fermentative bacteria.

Eating behaviors that matter

- Frequent snacking: Interrupts interdigestive migrating motor complex (MMC) activity, a housekeeping movement that limits bacterial stasis in the small intestine.
- Large, infrequent meals or late-night eating: Can burden digestion and affect circadian regulation of gut function.

Evidence-based management principles

- Short-term low-FODMAP approach: A monitored elimination phase can reduce fermentable substrate and rapidly improve symptoms. Reintroduction and personalization are essential to avoid long-term diversity loss in the colonic microbiome.
- Address motility and MMC: Spacing meals (several hours without caloric intake), minimizing constant snacking, and correcting factors that impair motility can lower recurrence risk.
- Targeted testing: Stool- or sequencing-based microbiome tests can identify overrepresented species and inform targeted dietary adjustments rather than broad restriction.

Foods that can be tolerated more often

- Lower-FODMAP vegetables (zucchini, carrots, cucumbers), selected low-fructose fruits (berries), and lean proteins are generally easier on symptoms.
- Slowly fermentable fibers or non-fermentable bulking agents (psyllium, acacia) can be used in active phases with caution.

Summary

Avoiding high-FODMAP carbohydrates, refined sugars, certain additives, and disruptive eating patterns can reduce SIBO symptoms. Combine short-term, evidence-based dietary strategies with motility support and, when available, microbiome-informed personalization to minimize relapse and restore digestive function.
