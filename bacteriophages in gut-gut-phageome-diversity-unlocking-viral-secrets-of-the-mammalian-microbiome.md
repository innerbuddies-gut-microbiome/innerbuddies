# Gut Phageome Revealed: Viral Diversity in Mammalian Microbiomes

The mammalian gut houses not only bacteria and fungi but also a vast assemblage of viruses collectively termed the gut phageome. Predominantly composed of bacteriophages—viruses that infect bacteria—this viral community exerts substantial influence on microbial composition, metabolic function, and host physiology. Recent viral metagenomics studies have begun to map this hidden diversity and to clarify how phages contribute to microbiome stability and resilience.

## What the gut phageome is and why it matters

The gut phageome comprises free viral particles, temperate prophages integrated into bacterial genomes, and mobile genetic elements that move between microbial hosts. By lysing specific bacteria or transferring genes between strains, bacteriophages shape species abundance and functional potential within the gut ecosystem. These dynamics can affect processes as varied as short-chain fatty acid production, pathogen resistance, and mucosal immunity.

## Methods for assessing viral diversity

Advances in viral metagenomics and bioinformatics enable detection and classification of gut viruses from fecal and tissue samples. Techniques such as shotgun sequencing, viral particle enrichment, and long-read sequencing reduce bacterial background and improve recovery of viral genomes. Analytical pipelines now annotate viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs), predict host ranges, and identify auxiliary metabolic genes that phages may carry to modulate host bacterial metabolism.

## Typical viral constituents of the gut

Bacteriophages dominate the gut virome and include both lytic phages, which rapidly kill bacteria, and temperate phages, which integrate into bacterial genomes and may confer phenotypic traits. Other eukaryotic viruses are present at lower abundance and often reflect diet, environment, or transient infections. The dominance of phages means viral-bacterial interactions are central to ecosystem function in the gut.

## Ecological and clinical implications

Phage-driven predation imposes selective pressure that can maintain microbial diversity by preventing single-species overgrowth. Conversely, shifts in phage composition—due to antibiotics, diet, or illness—can destabilize bacterial communities and correlate with conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic disorders in observational studies. While causality is still being elucidated, mechanistic research shows phages can alter bacterial virulence and metabolic outputs in ways that plausibly affect host health.

## Toward personalized insights

Individual phageomes are highly personalized, reflecting host genetics, age, diet, and environmental exposures. Integrating virome data with bacterial and host measures improves resolution of microbiome states and may inform therapeutic strategies that modulate phage-bacteria interactions.

## Conclusion

Viral diversity in the gut is a key, yet underappreciated, component of mammalian microbiomes. Continued viral metagenomics and integrative studies are needed to define causal pathways and translational applications, while current evidence supports the phageome’s role in shaping microbial ecology and potentially influencing host health.
