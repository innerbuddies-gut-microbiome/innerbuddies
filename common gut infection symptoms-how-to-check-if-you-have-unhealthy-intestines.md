Unhealthy intestines can subtly affect digestion, energy, immunity, and mood. This short, evidence-based overview outlines common signs of intestinal imbalance, which clinical tests can help confirm, and practical next steps for evaluation.

## Why intestinal health matters

The intestines host a diverse microbiome—bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microbes—that support digestion, nutrient absorption, immune function and neuromodulation. Disruption of this ecosystem (dysbiosis), chronic inflammation, or compromised intestinal barrier function can produce wide-ranging symptoms. For a focused primer, see [How to check if I have unhealthy intestines?](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/how-to-check-if-you-have-unhealthy-intestines).

## Common signs of an unhealthy intestine

- Digestive symptoms: persistent bloating, gas, chronic constipation, recurrent diarrhea, or alternating bowel patterns. These suggest functional or microbial disturbances affecting transit and fermentation.
- Systemic effects: unexplained fatigue, brain fog, mood shifts (anxiety/depression), and new food sensitivities can reflect gut–brain and immune interactions.
- Inflammatory or immune clues: frequent infections, worsening allergies, skin conditions (eczema, rosacea) and joint aches may point to immune activation linked to gut permeability.
- Alarming features suggesting infection or significant inflammation: fever with abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, sudden weight loss, or severe vomiting—these warrant urgent clinical assessment.

## Tests and assessments to consider

A structured evaluation pairs symptom review with targeted testing. Common laboratory and functional approaches include:

- Stool analysis: identifies microbial composition, pathogenic organisms, blood, fat, and markers of inflammation (e.g., calprotectin).
- 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomic sequencing: provide taxonomic and functional insights into bacterial diversity and the presence of viruses or fungi.
- Functional metabolite testing: measures short-chain fatty acids and other microbial metabolites that influence barrier and immune function.
- SIBO breath testing and directed PCR panels: useful when small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or specific pathogens are suspected.

Laboratory data are most useful when interpreted alongside clinical context and symptom patterns rather than in isolation.

## Leaky gut and infections

“Increased intestinal permeability” (leaky gut) may be suspected when patients develop new food intolerances, systemic inflammation, or autoimmune flares. Reduced abundance of mucin-supporting taxa (e.g., Akkermansia) and butyrate producers can indicate barrier risk. Persistent post-infectious symptoms are common after gastroenteritis and can leave a footprint of dysbiosis; targeted testing can reveal these patterns.

## When to seek clinical care

If you have red-flag symptoms (blood in stool, high fever, severe pain, rapid weight loss) seek prompt medical evaluation. For chronic, non-urgent symptoms, discuss stool-based and functional testing with a primary care clinician or gastroenterology specialist to develop a diagnostic plan and interpret results in context.

Accurate assessment combines symptom recognition with targeted laboratory data to distinguish transient issues from treatable intestinal disorders.
