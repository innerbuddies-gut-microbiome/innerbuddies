With gut health playing an increasingly critical role in overall wellness, many people are asking whether microbiome tests can be paid for with pre-tax dollars from a Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA). This article summarizes the rules and practical steps to improve the odds of reimbursement while sticking to evidence-based guidance.

HSA and FSA accounts cover 'qualified medical expenses' as defined by the IRS, typically costs incurred to diagnose, treat, mitigate, or prevent disease. Routine wellness products or curiosity-driven tests generally do not qualify. However, when a microbiome test is recommended by a licensed clinician to investigate symptoms such as chronic bloating, unexplained gastrointestinal pain, or suspected small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), it may meet the threshold for HSA-eligible expenses.

Documentation is the key. A Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) stating symptoms, the clinical rationale for testing, and how results will affect treatment increases the likelihood that an HSA or FSA administrator will approve reimbursement. Itemized receipts, laboratory reports, and any CPT or procedure codes used by the lab are also useful supporting materials.

FSAs follow similar medical-necessity rules but are employer-administered and often have stricter spending windows. If you plan to use FSA funds for an at-home microbiome kit, confirm that your plan accepts diagnostic tests when paired with an LMN and that the testing lab meets clinical standards (e.g., CLIA compliance). If available, an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) processed through insurance can also help document the clinical intent.

There is no centralized, definitive 'HSA approved tests' list. Approval is case-by-case and depends on clinical context and administrator interpretation. Tests with documented clinical validity—processed by certified laboratories and integrated into a treatment pathway—are more defensible as qualified medical expenses.

Clinicians commonly order microbiome testing when treating conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s, ulcerative colitis), SIBO, recurrent yeast overgrowth, or unexplained food intolerances. When a licensed provider documents that results will guide specific therapeutic choices—dietary changes, targeted probiotics, or prescription therapy—the test aligns more closely with the IRS definition of a qualified medical expense.

Practical steps to maximize reimbursement chances:

- Obtain a Letter of Medical Necessity from a treating clinician.
- Keep detailed, itemized receipts and any lab documentation or CPT codes.
- Confirm lab certification (CLIA, FDA workflow compliance where relevant).
- Submit documentation to your HSA/FSA administrator before or with your claim.

In summary, microbiome testing can be HSA- or FSA-eligible when ordered for medical reasons and supported by appropriate documentation. Clear clinical intent and certified lab processing are the primary factors administrators consider when adjudicating claims.
