# Which microbiome test is the best?

The gut microbiome influences digestion, immunity, metabolism, and even aspects of mental health. Choosing the most informative microbiome test depends on your goals, whether that’s resolving digestive symptoms, tracking changes over time, or investigating metabolic or immune-related concerns. This article summarizes the main factors to consider and compares common testing approaches.

## What a good microbiome test should measure

High-quality microbiome tests identify microbial composition, quantify diversity, and provide functional predictions. Key outcomes include:

- Composition: which species or genera are present.
- Diversity: measures like alpha and beta diversity that indicate community balance.
- Functional insights: genes or pathways linked to short-chain fatty acid production, fiber degradation, or pathogenicity.

Accuracy, reproducibility, and the use of a large, current reference database matter for interpretation. For an overview of testing approaches and practical guidance, see [Which microbiome test is the best?](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/which-microbiome-test-is-the-best)

## Sequencing options: 16S vs. whole-genome shotgun

Two principal laboratory approaches are common:

- 16S rRNA gene sequencing: targets a bacterial marker gene and usually resolves to the genus level. It is lower cost and faster but excludes non-bacterial organisms and has limited taxonomic resolution.
- Whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing: sequences all DNA in the sample, allowing species-level identification and functional predictions for bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea. WGS is more comprehensive but costlier and data-intensive.

Choice depends on depth needed: 16S can be informative for broad patterning or population studies, while WGS is preferable for clinical questions, functional profiling, or when non-bacterial taxa matter.

## Stool sample testing and limitations

Stool testing provides the most direct window into colonic microbial communities. Typical outputs include composition, diversity indices, detection of opportunistic pathogens, and functional gene profiles. Important caveats:

- A single stool sample is a snapshot influenced by recent diet, medications, and collection timing.
- Shipping and preservation methods affect DNA integrity; follow kit instructions carefully.
- Interpretation benefits from clinical context—symptoms, medication history, and dietary patterns.

## Integrating microbiome data with clinical assessment

Microbiome information is most useful when combined with symptom logs, dietary records, and, where appropriate, clinical lab tests (e.g., inflammatory markers, stool calprotectin). This integrated view helps differentiate transient shifts from persistent dysbiosis and guides targeted dietary or therapeutic adjustments.

## How to choose

Decide based on your objective: routine monitoring and general insights may be served by 16S; clinical or functional questions favor WGS. Prioritize providers that document their sequencing methods, reference databases, and interpretation frameworks. Where available, pair microbiome results with clinical evaluation to make evidence-based adjustments to diet, lifestyle, or therapies.
