# What is dysbiosis?

Dysbiosis refers to an imbalance in the gut microbiome where the relative abundance, diversity, or function of microorganisms is altered compared with a healthy state. This disruption can affect digestion, immune function, nutrient synthesis, and signaling along the gut–brain axis. The term is used broadly in research and clinical contexts to describe microbial configurations associated with symptoms or disease risk rather than a single definable pathogen.

## Why dysbiosis matters

A balanced microbiome contributes to short-chain fatty acid production, vitamin synthesis, barrier integrity, and competitive exclusion of pathogens. When those functions are reduced—due to loss of beneficial taxa or expansion of opportunistic organisms—individuals may experience gastrointestinal symptoms (bloating, altered bowel habits, abdominal pain) and systemic effects such as fatigue, mood changes, or increased inflammatory markers. Multiple observational studies link dysbiotic patterns with conditions including IBS, IBD, metabolic syndrome, and some psychiatric disorders, though causality is often complex and bidirectional.

## Common causes and detectable patterns

Drivers of dysbiosis include dietary patterns low in fermentable fiber and high in processed foods, repeated or broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, chronic stress, disrupted sleep, environmental toxins, and certain medical conditions. Microbiome analyses commonly report decreased alpha-diversity, reductions in butyrate-producing taxa (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii), and overrepresentation of Proteobacteria or opportunistic fungi in dysbiotic samples. These patterns can provide clues about underlying contributors and therapeutic targets.

## Role of testing

Stool-based microbiome testing (16S rRNA sequencing or metagenomic approaches) offers a snapshot of microbial composition and inferred function. Interpreting these results requires context: clinical history, symptoms, diet, medications, and laboratory markers. Tests can be useful for tracking changes over time, identifying overgrowths or deficits, and guiding personalized interventions.

## Practical, evidence-informed approaches to restoration

Restoration strategies commonly focus on four domains: reduce drivers of imbalance (e.g., prudent antibiotic stewardship, stress reduction), provide substrates for beneficial microbes (diverse fiber and polyphenol-rich foods), introduce supportive microbes when indicated (specific probiotic strains shown in trials for particular conditions), and monitor response with follow-up testing if needed. Nutritional adjustments tailored to test results or symptoms can be more effective than generic recommendations; for examples of how microbiome data can inform personalized nutrition, see this overview: <a href='https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/microbiome-testing-is-it-the-future-of-personalized-nutrition'>Microbiome testing and personalized nutrition</a>.

## Interpreting results cautiously

Microbiome science is rapidly evolving. Single test results should not be overinterpreted without clinical correlation. Comparisons to population-level references (beta-diversity) and functional readouts are informative but not definitive diagnoses.
