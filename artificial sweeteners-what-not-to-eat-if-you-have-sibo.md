Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) occurs when bacteria that normally reside in the large intestine increase in the small intestine, fermenting carbohydrates and producing symptoms such as bloating, gas, abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Dietary modification is a core component of symptom management because limiting fermentable substrates can reduce bacterial activity and improve comfort.

If you want a concise primer on dietary avoidance and SIBO, see [What should you not eat if you have SIBO?](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/what-not-to-eat-if-you-have-sibo).

What to avoid and why

- Fermented foods: Sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt, kefir and kombucha contain live microbes that can increase bacterial load in the small intestine during an active SIBO phase. Ferments that contain residual sugars or lactose may be particularly problematic because they provide additional substrates for fermentation.

- High FODMAP foods: FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) are poorly absorbed short-chain carbohydrates that are rapidly fermented by bacteria. Common high-FODMAP offenders include garlic, onions, wheat, certain fruits (apples, pears, stone fruits), and legumes. Reducing these can lower fermentation, gas and bloating during treatment.

- Processed snacks and additives: Many convenience foods contain refined starches, maltodextrin, emulsifiers, preservatives and artificial additives that can promote dysbiosis or feed pathogenic strains. Maltodextrin, in particular, has been associated with shifts in bacterial populations and reduced microbial diversity in some studies.

- Artificial sweeteners and some sugar alcohols: Non-nutritive sweeteners (e.g., sucralose, saccharin) and fermentable polyols (sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol) may alter microbiome composition or serve as substrates for small intestinal bacteria, worsening symptoms in susceptible individuals.

- Lactose-containing dairy: Lactose requires lactase for digestion; when lactase activity is reduced or small-intestinal transit is altered, undigested lactose becomes available for bacterial fermentation, leading to gas, cramping and loose stools. Some aged cheeses and lactose-free dairy alternatives may be better tolerated.

Personalization through testing

Because individual microbiomes differ, blanket restrictions are not always necessary long-term. Microbiome analysis provides data on species abundance, methane- or hydrogen-producing profiles, and markers that help prioritize which fermentables to avoid or reintroduce. For clinicians and patients seeking structured insight, tests such as the <a href='https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test'>InnerBuddies Microbiome Test</a> can be used to tailor dietary strategies rather than relying on one-size-fits-all rules.

Summary

Avoiding fermentable substrates—fermented foods, high-FODMAP items, processed snacks with hidden additives, certain sweeteners and lactose-rich dairy—can reduce the fermentative burden in the small intestine during active SIBO. As symptoms improve, careful, data-driven reintroduction and ongoing monitoring are recommended to restore dietary variety while maintaining symptom control.
