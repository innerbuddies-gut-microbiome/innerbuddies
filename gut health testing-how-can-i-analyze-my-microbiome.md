# How can I analyze my microbiome?

Microbiome analysis provides a scientific window into gut health by identifying which microorganisms live in your digestive tract and how they function. This article summarizes common analytical approaches—sequencing methods, gut health tests, diversity metrics, and practical sample collection—to help you interpret results and plan evidence-based adjustments to diet or lifestyle.

## Sequencing approaches

Two sequencing strategies are most commonly used. 16S rRNA gene sequencing targets bacterial marker genes to provide a cost-effective overview of bacterial genera and community structure. Whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing reads all DNA in a sample, enabling species- and strain-level identification and insight into microbial functional potential (metabolic pathways, antibiotic resistance genes, and virus or fungal presence). Selecting a method depends on your goals: broad profiling vs. deep functional detail.

## Gut health testing beyond taxonomy

Sequencing shows who is present; gut health testing evaluates what the gut is doing. Common assays measure inflammation (calprotectin, lactoferrin), immune markers (secretory IgA), digestive function (elastase, bile acids), intestinal permeability markers (zonulin), and short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, acetate, propionate). Integrating functional tests with sequencing can clarify whether a seemingly balanced microbiota is associated with mucosal inflammation or impaired digestion.

## Assessing microbial diversity

Diversity is a useful ecological metric. Richness (number of taxa), evenness (distribution of abundance), and alpha/beta diversity indices are often reported. Higher diversity generally correlates with resilience, whereas low diversity has been associated with conditions such as obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, and metabolic dysfunction. Diversity scores are best interpreted relative to clinical context and reference populations.

## Best practices for sample collection

Accurate results start with proper collection. Use the sterile tools and preservative provided by testing services, avoid contaminating the sample with urine or toilet water, and ship promptly per kit instructions. Collect during a typical bowel movement rather than during acute illness or immediately after antibiotics unless the intent is to monitor those specific states.

## Interpreting results and next steps

Reports commonly include relative abundances, diversity scores, and functional inferences. Look for clinically relevant signals such as depletion of butyrate-producing taxa, overrepresentation of Proteobacteria, or markers of inflammation. These findings can inform targeted interventions—dietary fiber diversity, fermented foods, or clinician-directed therapies—but should be integrated with symptoms, medical history, and laboratory findings.
