Everyone has bacteria in their intestines — the question is whether that microbial community is supporting health or contributing to symptoms. This article summarizes what intestinal bacteria do, common signs that the gut community is imbalanced or infected, and which tests can provide useful, evidence-based information.

Understanding the role of intestinal bacteria

Intestinal bacteria are part of the gut microbiome, a diverse ecosystem that supports digestion, produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), synthesizes some vitamins, and helps train the immune system. A balanced microbiome tends to be diverse and rich in SCFA-producing groups (for example, Faecalibacterium and Roseburia). Dysbiosis — reduced diversity, loss of beneficial taxa, or expansion of opportunistic organisms — can follow antibiotics, poor diet, stress, medications (like PPIs), or travel-related exposure.

Signs that bacteria may be contributing to symptoms

Look for patterns: persistent bloating, excessive gas, changes in bowel habits (chronic diarrhea or constipation), abdominal cramping, and symptoms that began after antibiotics or travel. Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine (SIBO) often produces bloating and gas soon after meals. Methane-dominant overgrowth (linked to methanogens) is frequently associated with constipation, while hydrogen-dominant patterns are more often linked to diarrhea. Acute bacterial infections typically present with rapid onset of watery or bloody diarrhea, fever, and systemic signs such as dehydration.

Testing options and what they reveal

- Stool testing: Culture, PCR panels, and sequencing each provide different information. PCR and culture can detect specific pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, C. difficile) and, in the case of culture, allow for antibiotic susceptibility testing. Sequencing reports community composition and diversity metrics that are useful for longer-term ecological assessment but require clinical context.

- Breath testing: Glucose or lactulose hydrogen and methane breath tests measure gases produced by microbial fermentation and are commonly used to detect SIBO. Interpretation depends on timing and magnitude of gas rises and can be affected by transit time.

- Fecal inflammatory markers: Tests such as fecal calprotectin help distinguish inflammatory conditions (like IBD) from functional disorders.

- Small bowel aspirate: An invasive option used in specialized settings to directly sample small intestinal contents; historically considered a gold standard for SIBO but limited by practicality and contamination risk.

Interpreting results

No single test is definitive on its own. Sequencing can show reduced diversity or overrepresentation of certain taxa, but this is not diagnostic without symptoms or other findings. A positive pathogen PCR in symptomatic patients usually indicates infection that may warrant treatment. Breath test patterns should be interpreted alongside clinical history. Work with a clinician to combine test data with symptom timing, exposures, and medical history.

If testing is considered, choose validated methods and interpret results with a healthcare professional.
