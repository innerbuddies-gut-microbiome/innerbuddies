Introduction

The human gut microbiome comprises diverse microbes that influence digestion, immunity, metabolism, and behavior. Emerging evidence shows consistent biological differences between males and females in microbial composition, diversity, and function. For an in-depth overview, see [How Male and Female Gut Microbiomes Differ: A Scientific Deep Dive](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/male-vs-female-gut-microbiome-differences).

Sex as a biological variable

Recent studies and funding agency requirements emphasize sex as a biological variable. Male and female physiology — including hormones and immune patterns — creates distinct gut ecosystems. These differences are important in autoimmunity, metabolic disease, mental health, and drug response.

Key compositional patterns

General trends reported across cohorts include higher relative abundances of Bacteroides, Alistipes, and Ruminococcus in many males, and greater Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Prevotella in many females. Alpha diversity (within-individual richness) findings are mixed, with some datasets showing slightly higher diversity in males; beta diversity (between-individual variation) can be higher among females.

Hormonal and immune interactions

Sex hormones — estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone — shape microbial communities. Estrogen often promotes Lactobacillus and helps maintain gut barrier integrity via interactions with the estrobolome, the bacterial ensemble that metabolizes estrogens. Testosterone has been linked to Bacteroides enrichment and can alter short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiles. Females also tend to mount stronger innate and adaptive immune responses, which affects microbial colonization and resilience and may help explain sex-biased prevalence of autoimmune conditions.

Diet, behavior, and life stage

Behavioral patterns influence microbial ecology: dietary differences (e.g., higher red meat and alcohol intake in some male populations versus more plant and fermented food consumption in some female populations) produce divergent microbiome signatures. Life stages — from neonatal colonization and puberty-related hormonal shifts to menopause and andropause — drive sex-specific microbial trajectories.

Disease associations

Sex-specific microbiome patterns are implicated in disease risk. Autoimmune diseases such as lupus and multiple sclerosis are more common in women and may involve stronger microbiome–immune interactions. Males often show greater risk for metabolic syndrome and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, potentially linked to distinct microbial metabolite profiles. The gut–brain axis also demonstrates sex-dependent signaling relevant to anxiety and depression.

Estrobolome and androgen-modulating microbes

The estrobolome modulates circulating estrogen and can influence conditions such as hormone-sensitive cancers and menopausal symptoms. Certain microbes produce enzymes that modify androgens, with downstream effects on metabolism, muscle biology, and behavior; for example, Clostridium scindens participates in steroid-transforming pathways.

Implications and next steps

Understanding sex-based microbiome differences supports precision approaches to nutrition, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Ongoing research priorities include sex-specific probiotic formulations, microbiome dynamics in gender-affirming hormone therapy, and integrating sex into microbiome-based predictive models.
