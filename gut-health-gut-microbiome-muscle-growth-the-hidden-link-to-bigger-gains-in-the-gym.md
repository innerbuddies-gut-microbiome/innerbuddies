The gut-muscle axis describes the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and skeletal muscle. Emerging research shows that microbial metabolites, nutrient processing and immune signaling can influence muscle mass, function and recovery. Understanding these pathways helps explain why diet, exercise and medication history can modulate training outcomes.

Functional bacterial pathways with relevance to muscle hypertrophy include short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, lactate metabolism, amino acid synthesis and bile acid transformation. SCFAs such as butyrate, acetate and propionate arise from microbial fermentation of dietary fiber. Butyrate can influence the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling—central to protein synthesis—and can also support mitochondrial function while reducing markers of muscle atrophy. These properties make SCFA-producing communities an important factor for maintaining muscle health.

Some gut bacteria interact directly with exercise-derived metabolites. For example, Veillonella species ferment lactate into propionate, which may serve as an auxiliary energy substrate during prolonged activity. Preclinical studies found that colonization with Veillonella atypica improved endurance in mice, illustrating a specific microbial mechanism that links exercise chemistry to host performance.

Gut microbes also modulate amino acid availability. Certain taxa synthesize or salvage branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) like leucine, isoleucine and valine—nutrients that stimulate muscle protein synthesis and help limit degradation after resistance training. Additionally, microbial modification of primary bile acids into secondary bile acids can alter host metabolic signaling and inflammation, indirectly affecting muscle adaptation and energy utilization.

Experimental evidence supports a meaningful role for the microbiome in muscle outcomes. Germ-free and antibiotic-treated animal models often display reduced muscle mass and impaired function, highlighting the importance of microbial signals for muscle integrity. Targeted probiotic supplementation in animals—using strains such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium—has been associated with improved muscle mass and strength measures. Human observational studies are beginning to link higher abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria with better muscle function in older adults, though quantifying the microbiome’s isolated effect on hypertrophy in people remains complex due to interacting variables (diet, genetics, exercise program and health status).

Practical strategies to support a muscle-friendly microbiome emphasize consistent, evidence-based habits. A diet rich in diverse dietary fibers feeds SCFA-producing microbes; fermented foods and carefully selected probiotic or prebiotic interventions can modulate composition; regular aerobic and resistance exercise tends to increase microbial diversity; judicious antibiotic use helps preserve microbiome resilience; and managing chronic stress and optimizing sleep supports microbial stability and recovery.
