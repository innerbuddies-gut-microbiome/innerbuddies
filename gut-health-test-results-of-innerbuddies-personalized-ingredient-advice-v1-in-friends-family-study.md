# Test results of InnerBuddies personalized ingredient advice V1 in Friends & Family Study

This summary presents the design and key outcomes of an internal Friends & Family pilot that evaluated InnerBuddies' personalized ingredient advice V1. The pilot focused on whether short-term, individualized dietary guidance could shift gut microbiome indicators associated with health.

Study design and intervention

The V1 advice compared a participant’s abundance of the InnerBuddies top 35 bacteria to ranges derived from an internal Healthy Cohort. Bacteria were categorized as positive, negative, or other relevant taxa and flagged as "be aware" when they fell outside the healthy range (below the cohort minimum for positive taxa or above the cohort maximum for negative taxa). Seven gut-health categories were mapped to specific bacteria and to bacterial pathways; ingredient advice listed food items connected to pathways associated with flagged categories. Daily dosages per item were based on dietitian guidance.

The Friends & Family pilot included 50 enrolled participants, 40 of whom completed the full protocol. The 4-week intervention (September 2022) used personalized weekly menus aligned to each participant’s V1 ingredient advice. Four stool samples were collected per participant: an initial sample in June 2022 used to build recommendations, a baseline just before the 4-week test, a mid-test sample at week 2, and a final sample at week 4. Adherence was monitored informally through the study team, and participants were grouped by adherence into GREEN (high), YELLOW (moderate), and ORANGE (limited) cohorts.

Primary microbiome outcomes

Diversity metrics improved across the cohort during the 4-week period. Key aggregated changes reported were:

- Shannon Index: +5.17%
- Number of OTUs: +9.22%
- Pielou’s Evenness: +3.64%

Groups with higher adherence (GREEN) showed larger improvements in evenness and Shannon Index compared with YELLOW and ORANGE groups. The directionality suggests a positive association between adherence to the personalized ingredient advice and short-term increases in gut microbiome diversity, a metric repeatedly associated in the literature with better gut health.

Selected taxon-level changes

Reported mean changes across participants included increases in several taxa considered beneficial (e.g., Akkermansia +96.69%, Ruminococcaceae +178.12%, Lactobacillus +24.56%, Bifidobacterium +23.54%) and decreases in certain taxa classified as negative (e.g., Klebsiella −34.27%, Escherichia–Shigella −16.78%). These shifts indicate that targeted dietary adjustments can move abundances in the expected direction over a short term in a motivated cohort.

Limitations and next steps

This pilot was an internal, non-randomized test without clinical trial registration or external peer review. Participants were primarily known to the study team, which aided adherence assessment but limits generalizability. Results should be interpreted as preliminary and hypothesis-generating.

InnerBuddies plans to transition the recommendation engine from a taxa-focused approach to a bacterial pathway (functional) focus to enable more stable, scalable, and functionally targeted interventions. Further validation via controlled clinical trials and academic collaboration is planned.
