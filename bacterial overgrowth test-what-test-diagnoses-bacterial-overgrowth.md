Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) occurs when bacterial populations in the small intestine increase or shift in composition, causing bloating, pain, altered bowel habits, and nutrient malabsorption. Accurate testing matters because symptoms overlap with other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and carbohydrate malabsorption. This article summarizes the main diagnostic approaches, their strengths and limitations, and how clinicians distinguish SIBO from related disorders.

### Key diagnostic methods

- Breath testing (non-invasive): The most commonly used clinical approach is breath testing with substrates such as lactulose or glucose, measuring hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) in exhaled breath. An early rise in hydrogen or methane after ingestion suggests small bowel fermentation of the test substrate and supports a SIBO diagnosis. Glucose breath tests favor detection of proximal overgrowth (higher specificity), while lactulose can detect more distal fermentation but is more vulnerable to transit-related false positives. Standardized pretest preparation and simultaneous hydrogen/methane measurement improve clinical utility.

- Jejunal aspirate and culture (direct): Endoscopic collection of small intestinal fluid and culture quantifies bacterial colony-forming units and can identify organisms and susceptibilities. It is historically considered a reference method but is invasive, samples a limited area, and may miss fastidious organisms.

- Complementary studies: Imaging (CT/MRI) and motility testing identify structural or functional contributors (e.g., strictures, blind loops, hypomotility) that predispose to overgrowth. Emerging assays target additional gases (e.g., hydrogen sulfide) or use molecular sequencing, though these are not yet standardized for routine SIBO diagnosis.

### Distinguishing SIBO from carbohydrate malabsorption

Carbohydrate malabsorption (lactose or fructose intolerance) produces similar symptoms. Breath tests using the specific sugar (lactose or fructose) help diagnose primary malabsorption when gas rises occur on a timing consistent with colonic fermentation. An early gas rise favors small bowel fermentation (possible SIBO). Clinicians integrate timing, symptom correlation, and, when needed, perform SIBO-directed tests (glucose or lactulose breath tests) before or alongside carbohydrate-specific tests.

### Interpretation caveats

False positives/negatives arise from recent antibiotics or probiotics, poor pretest preparation, altered transit time, or non-measured gases (e.g., H2S). Methane-dominant overgrowth may present with low hydrogen but elevated methane; measuring both gases reduces missed cases. When results conflict with clinical suspicion, repeat testing after addressing confounders or pursuing direct sampling and imaging is reasonable.

### Role of stool microbiome testing

Stool-based microbiome tests characterize colonic communities and are useful for broader dysbiosis assessment and longitudinal monitoring, but they do not directly diagnose SIBO because stool reflects the colon rather than the small intestine. Combining breath testing with stool analysis can offer a more complete view for long-term management; for example, consumer-focused kits such as <a href='https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test'>InnerBuddies microbiome test</a> provide colonic microbiome context useful in follow-up.

For practical guidance on SIBO testing protocols and interpretation, clinicians may consult consensus guidelines and reviews.

In summary, breath testing (lactulose or glucose with H2 and CH4 measurement) is the practical first-line approach; jejunal aspirate remains the direct method when definitive microbiology is required. Test selection and interpretation should be integrated with clinical context, imaging, and consideration of motility or structural factors.
