Understanding links between the gut microbiome and mood is an active area of research. Emerging evidence indicates that people with depression often show reduced abundance of specific beneficial gut bacteria and lower overall microbial diversity. These shifts can influence neurotransmitter production, immune signaling and intestinal barrier integrity — all factors implicated in depressive disorders.

Key genera and species commonly reported as depleted in depression include Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, the butyrate-producing Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus and Roseburia. Losses in these taxa can reduce short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, lower anti-inflammatory capacity, and impair microbial contributions to serotonin, GABA and dopamine pathways. Animal and human studies have linked such deficits to increased systemic inflammation, altered HPA-axis responses and behavioral changes consistent with low mood.

Microbiome testing can reveal these patterns in individuals.

Specific strains of interest for mood modulation — often called 'psychobiotics' — include Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, Lactobacillus rhamnosus JB-1, Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001 and Bifidobacterium breve CCFM1025.

Clinical research indicates that reductions in Faecalibacterium and Coprococcus are especially consistent across depressed cohorts; both genera contribute to butyrate production, which supports colonocyte health and exerts systemic anti-inflammatory effects. Conversely, increases in pro-inflammatory taxa such as Eggerthella, Alistipes and certain Clostridium groups have been observed and are hypothesized to contribute to endotoxin-mediated neuroinflammation.

Interpreting a personal microbiome profile requires context: diet, medications (notably antibiotics), chronic stress and sleep patterns all shape the microbiota. Tests that report on bacterial abundance and functional capacity (e.g., SCFA production potential, mucin degradation, neurotransmitter precursor synthesis) can help prioritize interventions. One example of a consumer-facing resource that provides microbiome composition and function reports is <a href='https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test'>InnerBuddies microbiome test</a>.

Interventions informed by testing typically emphasize dietary fiber and diverse plant foods, fermented foods, prebiotics, and targeted probiotic strains where evidence supports benefit. Importantly, the field remains nascent: while several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses report modest mood improvements with specific probiotics, larger and longer studies are needed to define strain-specific indications and personalization strategies.

In summary, depression-associated microbial signatures commonly show depletion of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Coprococcus and Roseburia alongside reduced diversity. Microbiome-informed assessment offers a biologically plausible route to identify these deficiencies and to monitor interventions, but clinical integration requires careful interpretation and collaboration with healthcare providers.
