# Feeling Anxious or Tired? Your Gut May Be Affecting Your Mental Health

Anxiety and fatigue are common, often overlapping complaints that affect daily function and quality of life. While psychological and social factors are important, accumulating evidence indicates the digestive system — specifically the gut microbiome — can influence mood, energy, and stress regulation. This article reviews key mechanisms and practical strategies to support mental well-being via gut health.

## The gut–brain axis: how the gut communicates with the brain

The gut–brain axis is a bidirectional communication network connecting the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. Neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic pathways convey information both ways. Microbial communities in the gut produce metabolites and signaling molecules (for example, short-chain fatty acids and neurotransmitter precursors) that modulate inflammation, vagal nerve activity, and brain function. Dysregulation in these pathways has been associated with symptoms such as low mood, anxiety, poor concentration, and fatigue.

## Evidence linking microbiome composition to anxiety and fatigue

Clinical and preclinical studies suggest differences in gut microbial diversity and composition in people reporting anxiety disorders or chronic fatigue symptoms. Lower microbial diversity and a depletion of certain beneficial taxa have been correlated with increased systemic inflammation and altered production of compounds involved in mood regulation (for instance, serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid). While causality remains an active area of research, interventions that modify the microbiome have produced changes in behavioral and physiological measures in some trials.

## Signs that the gut may be contributing to mental symptoms

Beyond digestive complaints, indicators that gut function could be affecting mental well-being include persistent, unexplained fatigue, heightened anxiety without an obvious trigger, brain fog, disrupted sleep, and fluctuating mood. If these symptoms persist despite standard lifestyle adjustments, investigating gut health may provide additional insight.

## Practical, evidence-informed steps to support the microbiome

- Diet: Increasing dietary fiber and diverse plant foods supports microbial diversity. Fermented foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut) can introduce live microbes and fermented metabolites that may influence gut–brain signaling. Reducing intake of highly processed foods and excess added sugars can also help.
- Lifestyle: Regular physical activity, consistent sleep patterns, and stress-reduction practices (for example, mindfulness or relaxation techniques) influence both the microbiome and brain health.
- Medical considerations: Avoiding unnecessary antibiotic exposure and addressing underlying gastrointestinal conditions with a healthcare professional are important.
- Personalization: Because individuals differ in their microbiome composition and responses, tailored approaches informed by testing and professional guidance are increasingly used in research and practice.

## Summary

Current evidence supports a meaningful connection between gut microbiome status and symptoms such as anxiety and fatigue. Dietary variety, fermented foods, regular exercise, adequate sleep, stress management, and judicious medical care can support microbial and mental health. Personalized assessment of the microbiome may help clarify individual contributors and guide tailored strategies.
