Introduction

Over the last decade, researchers have moved beyond correlation to demonstrate causal relationships between gut microbiota and specific medical indications. A combination of experimental approaches—fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), germ-free animal models, antibiotic perturbation, and Mendelian randomization (MR)—has enabled these advances. This article summarizes nine areas where causal evidence has been established or strongly supported and links to a focused review of these studies.

Overview of key findings

1) Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)
Multiple studies using human cohort data and animal transfers show that dysbiotic communities can promote intestinal inflammation. Transplanting microbiota from IBD patients into susceptible mice exacerbates colitis, supporting a causal role for altered taxa such as reduced Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and increased pathobionts.

2) Obesity
Germ-free mice colonized with microbiota from obese donors gain more adiposity than those receiving lean donor microbiota. These experiments, together with metabolic profiling, indicate that microbiome composition can causally influence energy harvest and fat accumulation.

3) Autoimmune diseases
Two-sample Mendelian randomization and experimental models implicate specific bacterial taxa in autoimmune risk. Genetic instruments for gut taxa have been associated with disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, suggesting directional effects of microbes on immune-mediated disease.

4) Type 2 diabetes (T2D)
Animal transfer studies and mechanistic work on short‑chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and gut barrier function link microbiome alterations to insulin resistance. While human causality is still being refined, experimental models provide strong mechanistic evidence.

5) Infectious diseases
MR analyses and mechanistic studies reveal that certain commensals can increase or decrease susceptibility to infections. Microbiota composition affects colonization resistance, pathogen outgrowth, and mucosal immunity in ways that can be causally tested in vivo.

6) Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)
Genetic and observational MR approaches have identified taxa such as Ruminococcaceae and Faecalibacterium with causal associations to IBS symptoms, supporting a microbe-mediated component to symptom generation.

7) Depression and behavior
FMT from patients with major depressive disorder into rodents induces depressive‑like behaviors and changes in neurotransmitter systems, providing experimental evidence that gut microbial communities can influence mood and brain function.

8) Alzheimer’s disease
In transgenic mouse models, manipulating the gut microbiota (antibiotics, probiotics, or FMT) alters amyloid deposition and cognitive outcomes, implicating microbiome‑driven neuroinflammation and metabolite signaling in disease progression.

9) Cardiovascular disease (CVD)
Microbial metabolism of dietary substrates produces trimethylamine‑N‑oxide (TMAO), which has been mechanistically linked to atherosclerosis in animal models and associated with greater CVD risk in humans, supporting a causal metabolic pathway.

Implications and resources

These studies collectively illustrate how diverse methods can converge to establish causality and outline potential therapeutic targets (for example, modulating SCFA producers or TMA‑forming bacteria).

Conclusion

Causal evidence linking the gut microbiome to multiple medical indications is growing through rigorous experimental and genetic approaches. Continued translation will depend on well‑controlled human trials and mechanistic clarity about which taxa, metabolites, or host pathways drive specific disease processes.
