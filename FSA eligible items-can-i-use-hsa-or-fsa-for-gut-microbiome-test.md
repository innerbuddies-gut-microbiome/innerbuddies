Introduction

The gut microbiome influences digestion, immunity, nutrient absorption, and aspects of mental health. As interest in microbiome testing grows, many people wonder whether these tests can be reimbursed through tax-advantaged accounts. This article summarizes how Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) typically treat gut microbiome tests and practical steps to pursue reimbursement. For more detail, see [Can I Use HSA or FSA to Pay for a Gut Microbiome Test?](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/can-i-use-hsa-or-fsa-for-gut-microbiome-test).

Diagnostic intent and IRS guidance

IRS-qualified medical expenses are those incurred for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Laboratory tests ordered by a clinician for a specific medical purpose generally meet this definition. The critical distinction is intent: tests purchased solely for curiosity or general wellness are less likely to qualify than tests tied to a documented medical concern such as persistent bloating, IBS, unexplained GI symptoms, or suspected inflammatory processes.

Medical necessity and documentation

If a healthcare provider recommends a microbiome test to diagnose or manage a condition, you should document that recommendation. A Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) that states the condition, why the test is necessary, and how it will be used in treatment strengthens a reimbursement claim. Many administrators require an LMN for less common diagnostic items; keep copies of results, receipts, and the LMN for your records.

How HSAs and FSAs differ in practice

HSAs are individually owned and have favorable tax treatment for qualified expenses. FSAs are employer-established and typically have use-it-or-lose-it rules or limited carryovers. Both accounts generally permit reimbursement for physician-ordered laboratory diagnostics, but plan-level administrators may apply varying interpretations. Contact your HSA or FSA administrator before purchasing to confirm their documentation requirements.

Practical reimbursement steps

1. Obtain clinical documentation: Request an LMN or a clinician’s written recommendation describing the medical purpose.  
2. Verify provider acceptability: Some administrators require tests from accredited labs or clinician-ordered services.  
3. Pay and file: Use your HSA/FSA card if available, or pay and submit a reimbursement claim with the receipt and LMN.  
4. Retain records: Keep documentation for at least three years in case of audits.

Examples where tests are more likely eligible

- Chronic gastrointestinal symptoms (bloating, diarrhea/constipation) where a clinician uses results to guide therapy.  
- Patients with suspected dysbiosis linked to systemic or dermatologic conditions when testing informs a treatment plan.  
- Pediatric cases where a clinician includes testing as part of diagnostic evaluation for behavioral and GI concerns.

Conclusion

Gut microbiome tests can be HSA- or FSA-eligible when ordered for a documented medical purpose and accompanied by appropriate clinical documentation. Because administrator policies vary, confirming coverage details and collecting an LMN before purchase reduces the risk of denial.
