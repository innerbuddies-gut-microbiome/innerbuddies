Many people experience intermittent digestive upset and assume it is normal. Yet persistent changes in digestion, mood, energy or skin health can indicate disturbed intestinal function. This article summarizes common signs of unhealthy intestines, what they may reflect, and how targeted analysis can clarify underlying causes.

Digestive symptoms are often the most obvious signals. Recurrent bloating, excess gas, heartburn and irregular bowel movements (constipation, diarrhea, or alternating patterns) frequently indicate an imbalance in the gut ecosystem. Bloating can stem from excessive fermentation by certain microbes, while heartburn may relate to altered gastric and esophageal function influenced by microbial shifts. Persistent symptoms deserve assessment rather than simple symptomatic treatment.

Food-related signs—including new or worsening sensitivities and intense cravings—are also relevant. A compromised intestinal barrier can permit partially digested food particles into circulation, provoking inflammatory reactions that appear as headache, joint pain, skin flares or digestive distress after specific foods. Conversely, overgrowth of sugar-loving organisms can drive pronounced carbohydrate cravings via gut–brain signaling pathways.

Abdominal pain and chronic discomfort often reflect localized inflammation, pathogenic overgrowth, or conditions that affect motility. Disorders such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), inflammatory bowel conditions, and microbial imbalances can produce cramping, distension and pain that fluctuate with meals and stress. When pain is persistent or progressive, differential diagnosis and laboratory evaluation are important.

Bowel irregularities provide clear, observable data about intestinal function. Slow transit and hard stools may point to reduced production of short-chain fatty acids or impaired motility, while frequent loose stools can indicate rapid transit, infection, or immune-mediated responses. Both extremes can impair nutrient absorption and worsen systemic symptoms.

Systemic signs extend beyond the gut. Chronic fatigue, brain fog and certain skin conditions (acne, eczema, rosacea) are increasingly linked to gut-derived inflammation and altered microbial metabolites. For example, microbial components that enter circulation can trigger low-grade systemic inflammation and affect neurotransmitter production, which influences mood and cognition.

Laboratory-backed analysis can help distinguish possible causes. For those seeking data-driven insight, [gut microbiome testing](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/symptoms-of-unhealthy-intestines) can reveal microbial diversity, relative abundances, and markers associated with inflammation or barrier dysfunction. Complementary resources on specific diagnostic approaches include an overview of a non-invasive H. pylori stool test (<a href='https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/h-pylori-stool-test-non-invasive-diagnosis-for-stomach-infections'>non-invasive H. pylori stool test</a>) and broader perspectives on aging and the microbiome (<a href='https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/unlock-the-secrets-of-healthy-aging-the-gut-microbiome-and-you'>gut microbiome and healthy aging</a>), which illustrate how intestinal health influences systemic physiology. A supplemental discussion on microbiome roles in longevity is also available (<a href='https://telegra.ph/Unlock-the-Secrets-of-Healthy-Aging-The-Gut-Microbiome-and-You-12-10-2'>healthy aging and the microbiome</a>).

Testing approaches vary in scope and methodology; some assays profile microbial DNA from stool and report on potential pathogenic overgrowths, beneficial taxa, and inflammation markers. For clinics and individuals considering test-guided strategies, information about available assays can be informative (<a href='https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test'>gut microbiome test</a>).

Recognizing early signs and using appropriate diagnostic tools helps move from symptom management to addressing root contributors. Persistent or worsening symptoms merit evaluation by a clinician who can interpret testing in context and recommend evidence-based interventions.
