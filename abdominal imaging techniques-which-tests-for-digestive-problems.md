Digestive symptoms such as bloating, constipation, diarrhea, reflux and abdominal pain are common and multifactorial. Selecting appropriate diagnostic tests depends on symptom pattern, duration, red flags (for example weight loss, bleeding or anemia), and whether structural, biochemical, infectious or functional causes are suspected. This article summarizes standard assessments and how microbiome-focused testing can complement them.

Clinical assessment begins with history and physical examination, but laboratory and procedural tests provide objective information. Basic blood tests (including complete blood count, inflammatory markers and liver function tests) can identify systemic inflammation, anemia, or hepatic causes of digestive symptoms. Imaging techniques such as abdominal ultrasound, CT or MRI evaluate structural pathology, obstruction or masses; for an overview of abdominal imaging techniques see <a href='https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/is-a-gut-microbiome-test-worth-it'>Is a gut microbiome test worth it?</a> and consider how imaging and functional tests integrate.

Stool analysis is central when infection, inflammation or malabsorption is suspected. Culture-based tests and PCR pathogen panels detect bacteria, viruses and parasites, while fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin indicate intestinal inflammation suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease. Comprehensive stool microbiome sequencing provides taxonomic and functional information—diversity indices, presence or absence of keystone species, short-chain fatty acid profiles and potential pathogen overgrowth. These data can help explain persistent functional symptoms when endoscopic and imaging studies are unrevealing.

Endoscopic procedures directly visualize mucosal surfaces. Gastroscopy (upper endoscopy) inspects the esophagus, stomach and duodenum and allows biopsies for H. pylori testing, celiac disease confirmation, or histologic evaluation of gastritis and ulcers. Colonoscopy evaluates the colon and rectum, permits polyp removal and biopsies for suspected colitis. Tissue biopsies may be used for targeted microbial or molecular testing when indicated. Combining endoscopy with stool-based microbiome or pathogen testing offers both structural and ecological perspectives.

Liver function tests and pancreatic enzyme measurements are important when right upper quadrant pain, jaundice or steatorrhea appear; these tests can identify hepatobiliary or pancreatic causes that mimic primary gut disorders.

Gut microbiome testing has emerged as an adjunctive tool rather than a standalone diagnostic. Sequencing-based stool tests characterize microbial composition and predicted function; they are informative for suspected dysbiosis, persistent IBS-like symptoms, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (in selected contexts) or after antibiotic exposure. Interpretation requires clinical correlation since microbial patterns overlap across conditions and causality is not always established.

When deciding which tests to order, clinicians weigh symptom severity, red flags, and prior test results. Structural concerns or alarm features typically prompt imaging or endoscopy; suspected infectious or inflammatory causes favor stool panels and inflammatory markers; chronic functional symptoms with normal standard workup may justify microbiome and functional stool testing.

No single test answers every question; combining targeted structural, biochemical and microbiome assessments provides the most informative clinical picture. Interpretation should be evidence-based and integrated with clinical findings.
