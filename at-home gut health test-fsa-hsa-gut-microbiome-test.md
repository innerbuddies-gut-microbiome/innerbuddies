Introduction

Interest in the gut microbiome has grown as research links gut microbes to digestion, immunity, metabolism, and even mental health. At-home microbiome testing gives individuals a personalized snapshot of microbial composition and potential imbalances. Because these tests can be moderately priced, many people ask whether Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) or Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) can be used to cover the cost. This article summarizes evidence-based guidance and practical steps to improve the likelihood of reimbursement.

What these tests measure

Gut microbiome tests typically analyze a stool sample using methods such as 16S rRNA or shotgun metagenomic sequencing to profile microbial taxa and, in some cases, metabolic by-products. Reports may include diversity metrics, relative abundances, and actionable insights about diet or lifestyle that could influence microbial balance. Costs range based on depth of analysis and added services; a single at-home test commonly falls in the low- to mid-hundreds of dollars.

FSA and HSA eligibility: the core principle

Both FSAs and HSAs are tax-advantaged accounts intended to pay for qualified medical expenses. The IRS generally allows reimbursement for diagnostic tests when the expense is primarily for diagnosing, mitigating, treating, or preventing a specific disease. Tests purchased for general wellness or curiosity typically do not meet that standard.

When microbiome testing may qualify

A microbiome test is more likely to be eligible if it is part of clinical care for specific symptoms—such as persistent bloating, chronic diarrhea, unexplained weight changes, or suspected small intestinal bacterial overgrowth—especially when ordered or recommended by a clinician. Documentation helps: a provider’s prescription or a letter of medical necessity (LOMN) stating the test’s role in diagnosis or treatment strengthens an FSA/HSA claim.

Practical steps to improve reimbursement chances

- Consult your clinician before ordering and request a prescription or LOMN if the test is clinically indicated.
- Keep itemized receipts and any lab reports; some administrators require a clear description of services.
- Check with your plan administrator or HR about any pre-approval requirements and whether point-of-sale FSA/HSA card payments are accepted by the vendor.
- Choose tests that provide clear, itemized invoices and privacy-compliant reporting.

Summary

FSAs and HSAs can cover microbiome testing when the expense is a qualified diagnostic service linked to a specific medical concern and properly documented. Consult your clinician and plan administrator before purchasing to ensure you meet documentation and administrative requirements.
