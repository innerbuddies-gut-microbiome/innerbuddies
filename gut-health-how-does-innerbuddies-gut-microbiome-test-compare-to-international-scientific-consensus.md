# Why international microbiome testing guidelines matter

On 5 December 2024 an international expert panel published a consensus statement setting out best practices for microbiome testing in clinical practice. These recommendations address laboratory workflows, data analysis, reporting standards, pre- and post-test procedures, and the current limits of clinical utility. Clear guidance is important because microbial sequencing technologies are advancing quickly, but evidence for diagnostic or therapeutic decisions remains uneven across conditions.

# Summary of InnerBuddies’ alignment with the consensus

InnerBuddies reviewed its existing consumer test against the panel’s 35 statements. The company reports full compliance with 32 statements and partial compliance with three. The following summarizes how the main recommendations map to the company’s processes and where pragmatic compromises have been made.

## Multidisciplinary expertise, quality and data protection

The panel recommends multidisciplinary teams and accredited laboratories with data protection safeguards. InnerBuddies documents involvement of microbiology, nutrition/dietetics and computational expertise, and uses two external accredited laboratories with GDPR processing agreements in place. Sample handling procedures include collection materials and preservative buffers intended to maintain stability until freezing at arrival.

## Laboratory methods and computational pipelines

The consensus endorses amplicon and shotgun sequencing for community profiling and calls for validated pipelines and up-to-date reference databases. InnerBuddies uses 16S amplicon sequencing on Illumina MiSeq (V3/V4) and full‑16S on Oxford Nanopore, applies established preprocessing (primer removal, quality and chimera filtering), evaluates pipelines with mock samples, and uses the SILVA taxonomy database. The company reports ongoing experiments with shotgun sequencing.

## Reporting, diversity metrics and reference cohorts

Recommended reporting elements include alpha and beta diversity metrics, taxonomic profiling at the deepest reliable resolution, comparison with healthy controls, and transparency about methods. InnerBuddies provides alpha diversity (Shannon, Pielou, richness), compares results to a healthy cohort, offers downloadable taxonomic profiles, and avoids discouraged metrics such as the Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio and unvalidated dysbiosis indices. The company retains some methodological details as proprietary but indicates these will be disclosed for clinical products.

## Clinical use, therapeutic advice and data access

The consensus cautions against routine clinical use until evidence supports specific indications and advises that clinical management changes be made by treating clinicians. InnerBuddies distinguishes consumer tests from clinician-facing applications, does not provide diagnostic claims, and provides personalized nutrition, food diary and probiotic recommendations that integrate questionnaire and diet data with sequencing results. Raw data and taxonomic profiles are made available for download.

## Practical trade-offs: 16S versus shotgun sequencing

The panel highlights functional profiling (metabolic potential) as increasingly important. InnerBuddies explains its current choice of 16S amplicon sequencing for combined taxonomic and functional inference as a cost–accuracy trade-off: 16S-based functional prediction can capture much of the signal at lower cost, whereas shotgun sequencing is more accurate for pathways but substantially more expensive. The company indicates shotgun sequencing may be adopted for clinical, reimbursed products.

# Conclusion

The company’s documentation indicates substantial alignment with the international consensus across laboratory standards, analysis, reporting and data access, with pragmatic decisions made for consumer affordability and protected intellectual property.
