InnerBuddies today introduced a new service that translates gut microbiome data into tailored recommendations for probiotic strains and prebiotic-rich foods. The approach emphasises evidence-based strain selection, clarity on how recommendations are derived, and a food-first perspective that positions supplements as supportive rather than primary interventions.

Background and rationale

Research increasingly shows that the effectiveness of probiotic and prebiotic interventions depends on host microbiome composition, health objectives, and product quality. Generic recommendations can therefore be of limited value. InnerBuddies aims to align supplement guidance with an individual's microbial profile, highlighting strains with documented effects for specific outcomes and identifying relevant dietary sources of prebiotics.

Service features and methodology

Key features described for this personalised advice include: reliance on scientifically validated bacterial strains; alignment with stated health objectives (for example, digestive comfort or immune support) so only relevant strains are recommended; and transparency about the evidence base, including expert review and evidence scoring for strains. The service also emphasises product quality aspects — labelling, dosage, and safety — and provides practical, food-first guidance prioritising prebiotic-rich foods.

In practice the workflow is straightforward: a microbiome test produces a gut profile, computational and expert review maps that profile to validated strain–function relationships, and recommendations are assembled that pair dietary suggestions with optional supplement options where warranted. For an example of how personalised ingredient guidance has been evaluated in a small user study, see <a href='https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/test-results-of-innerbuddies-personalized-ingredient-advice-v1-in-friends-family-study'>test results of InnerBuddies’ personalized ingredient advice</a>.

Evidence and limitations

The service emphasises strains and interventions supported by scientific publications and notes that evidence strength varies by strain and outcome. Where randomized controlled trials or systematic reviews are lacking, recommendations can be conservatively constrained or presented with lower evidence scores. Users and clinicians should interpret microbiome-based recommendations alongside clinical context, dietary factors, and existing medical advice. For broader context on dietary approaches that interact with the gut microbiome, including symptom-guided strategies such as low-FODMAP diets, see this primer on the FODMAP approach: <a href='https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/the-fodmap-diet-a-beginners-guide'>The FODMAP Diet: A Beginner’s Guide</a>.

Transparency and practical guidance

Transparency in how recommendations are derived is a central element: the process links specific microbial markers to validated strain functions and explains why particular prebiotic foods or strains were suggested. Guidance on product selection covers typical quality indicators (e.g., strain designation, colony-forming units where applicable, storage requirements) and safety considerations.
