The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a bidirectional communication network linking the central nervous system, the enteric nervous system, immune signaling and the gut microbiota. Disturbances in this network can produce a range of disorders affecting digestion, mood and cognition. This article summarizes the most common conditions associated with GBA dysfunction and explains why microbiome analysis is increasingly relevant to diagnosis and management.

Common disorders linked to the gut-brain axis

- Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS): A prototypical gut-brain disorder, IBS features chronic abdominal pain, bloating and altered bowel habits without clear structural disease. Visceral hypersensitivity, abnormal motility and microbial imbalances (dysbiosis) are implicated in symptom generation.

- Mood disorders (depression and anxiety): Epidemiological and experimental data link low microbial diversity, inflammatory markers and altered microbial metabolites to depressive and anxiety symptoms. Gut-derived neurotransmitter production (e.g., serotonin, GABA) and modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are plausible mechanisms.

- Functional dyspepsia and gastroparesis: Disorders of upper GI function often involve disrupted enteric signaling and altered gastric motility. Microbial composition and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) can influence symptoms and gastric emptying.

- Neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions: Associations between microbiome signatures and autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as well as some forms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are emerging. While causality is complex, microbial metabolites and immune activation are frequent hypotheses.

- Neurodegenerative and autoimmune CNS disorders: Growing evidence links gut changes to Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis. For example, inflammatory microbial products and increased intestinal permeability have been proposed to promote systemic and central nervous system inflammation.

Mechanisms that connect gut and brain

Key pathways include microbial regulation of neurotransmitter production, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis, immune modulation (including endotoxin-mediated inflammation) and neural signaling via the vagus nerve. Dysbiosis can therefore influence brain function indirectly (immune and metabolic routes) and directly (neural pathways). The enteric nervous system (ENS) itself can suffer maladaptive changes that perpetuate symptoms.

Role of microbiome testing

Microbiome testing that profiles stool communities and functional markers can reveal dysbiosis, reduced SCFA-producers, pathogen overgrowth or inflammatory signatures. Such data are useful for hypothesis-driven care—identifying targets for dietary modification, selective probiotics (psychobiotics), or further clinical evaluation.

Conclusion

Gut-brain axis disorders span functional GI conditions, mood disorders and emerging links to neurodegenerative disease. Evidence supports roles for microbial metabolites, immune signaling and ENS/CNS communication. Microbiome profiling is a noninvasive tool that can clarify microbial contributions and inform tailored, evidence-informed strategies for clinicians and researchers working at the gut-brain interface.
