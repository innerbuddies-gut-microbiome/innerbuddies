A healthy gut microbiome is increasingly recognised as an important factor in athletic performance, recovery, and overall well‑being. Beyond digestion, gut microbes influence immunity, inflammation, nutrient absorption, and even muscle function. This article summarises current evidence on how exercise and the microbiome interact, practical dietary considerations for athletes, and the role of targeted interventions such as probiotics.

## Exercise and the microbiome: a two‑way relationship

Physical activity and the gut microbiome interact bidirectionally. Regular moderate exercise — including endurance and resistance training — tends to increase microbial diversity, which is associated with improved nutrient absorption, regulation of inflammation, and immune resilience. Conversely, a balanced microbiome can support training adaptations: animal studies suggest intact gut communities contribute to muscle cell responses, mitochondrial function, and aerobic capacity.

However, the relationship is not simply 'more is better.' Overtraining can reduce microbial diversity and promote inflammation, impairing recovery and gains. Antibiotic exposure during training further disrupts the microbiome and may blunt adaptations observed in animal models, such as reduced muscle growth and smaller increases in aerobic capacity.

## Antibiotics, supplementation, and targeted microbes

Antibiotics are sometimes necessary, but frequent use can transiently or persistently alter gut composition. Athletes may face higher antibiotic exposure due to infections or training environment risks; when antibiotics are required, supportive dietary strategies and monitored supplementation may help mitigate collateral effects.

Emerging work highlights specific bacterial taxa that could influence performance. For example, Veillonella species metabolise lactate into propionate, a compound linked in animal models to enhanced endurance. Early human trials are still inconclusive, but these findings point to the potential of personalised, microbe‑targeted approaches.

## Nutrition strategies for athletes

Diet remains the most practical lever to shape microbiome composition. Fibre is especially important as the primary substrate for beneficial microbes and short‑chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. Athletes consuming under 20 g/day of fibre are generally advised to increase intake gradually toward ~30 g/day over several weeks to support diversity, barrier function, and SCFA synthesis, while avoiding high fibre immediately before intense training to reduce GI discomfort.

Fermented foods (yoghurt, kefir, tempeh, kombucha) can provide live microbes and contribute to diversity. Where appropriate, evidence‑based probiotic strains — selected for documented effects, dose, and strain identity — may support immune health, gut barrier integrity, and recovery from muscle‑damaging exercise. The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) highlights strain‑ and dose‑dependence and calls for clearly labelled products with validated strains and CFU counts.

Summary: nurturing microbiome diversity through appropriate training loads, gradual increases in dietary fibre, fermented foods, and considered use of validated probiotic strains may support performance and recovery. Research is evolving, and interventions should be matched to individual needs and contexts.
