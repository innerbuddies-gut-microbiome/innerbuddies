Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) occurs when bacteria that normally live in the large intestine proliferate in the small intestine, disrupting digestion and nutrient absorption. Common symptoms include bloating, gas, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, and fatigue. Effective management requires accurate diagnosis, targeted antimicrobial therapy, dietary strategies, and measures to restore normal gut motility and microbial balance.

Diagnosis and targeted treatment

Accurate diagnosis usually begins with breath testing (hydrogen and methane) to confirm excess gas production in the small intestine. Combining breath test results with gut microbiome profiling can help tailor therapy. For a practical overview of diagnostic and personalized treatment options, see this [comprehensive guide on how to get rid of SIBO](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/how-to-get-rid-of-sibo).

Antimicrobial approaches

Antimicrobials remain a mainstay of treatment. Rifaximin is commonly used for hydrogen-predominant SIBO; methane-predominant SIBO often requires combination therapy (for example, rifaximin plus an agent targeting methanogens). Some practitioners use plant-based antimicrobials (oregano oil, berberine, allicin) as alternatives or adjuncts; evidence varies by agent and study quality. Treatment choice should account for breath-test phenotype, symptom pattern, prior antibiotic exposure, and patient preferences.

Dietary management

Diet can reduce fermentable substrates and ease symptoms while antimicrobials work. Low-FODMAP or elemental diets are used short-term to reduce fermentation; the low-fermentation strategies should be individualized to avoid unnecessary long-term restriction. Diet alone rarely eradicates SIBO, but it is useful for symptom control and as part of relapse prevention.

Restoring motility and microbiome balance

Impaired small-bowel motility and anatomical issues can predispose to recurrence. Prokinetic agents (prescription or certain natural options under supervision) support migrating motor complex activity between meals and may reduce relapse risk. Post-antibiotic strategies often include targeted probiotics or dietary approaches to rebuild beneficial flora; selection should be informed by testing when available.

Monitoring and relapse prevention

SIBO has a notable relapse rate. Ongoing symptom tracking, follow-up breath testing, and attention to underlying contributors—such as hypochlorhydria, prior abdominal surgery, or structural stasis—help guide long-term care. Where available, stool microbiome testing can add context to breath results and guide probiotic or dietary choices; one such option is <a href='https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test'>InnerBuddies Gut Microbiome Test</a>.

Practical considerations and resources

If you suspect SIBO, begin with symptom documentation and diagnostic testing rather than empiric long-term antibiotics. Integrating objective data (breath tests, microbiome profiles) with clinical findings improves the chance of durable remission.

Summary

Eliminating SIBO typically requires a multipronged plan: confirm phenotype with testing, apply targeted antimicrobials, use short-term dietary strategies for symptom relief, restore motility and microbial balance, and address predisposing factors to reduce relapse. Personalized, evidence-informed care improves outcomes and reduces the cycle of recurrence.
