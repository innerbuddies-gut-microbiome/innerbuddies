Introduction

The gut microbiome—the communities of bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microbes inhabiting the digestive tract—plays a critical role in digestion, immune function and overall health for companion animals. Advances in sequencing now allow analysis of stool samples to reveal bacterial diversity, functional capacity and imbalances that can relate to symptoms such as diarrhea, skin issues or chronic inflammation.

How testing works

Microbiome testing for pets typically analyzes a stool sample using methods like 16S rRNA sequencing or shotgun metagenomics. These tests report metrics such as species composition, diversity, relative abundances of key taxa, and functional markers (e.g., short-chain fatty acid producers). Results can help differentiate causes of GI signs, suggest dietary or probiotic approaches, and inform further veterinary diagnostics.

Can pets undergo gut microbiome testing?

Yes. Many laboratories and at-home kits enable stool-based analysis for dogs and cats. A contextual example of the consumer-facing guidance on this topic is available as [gut microbiome testing for pets](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/pets-gut-microbiome-testing). Test results are most useful when interpreted alongside clinical history, physical exam findings and routine diagnostics performed by a veterinarian.

Dog and cat differences

Dogs generally exhibit higher microbial diversity and a broader capacity for fermenting dietary fiber, with common bacterial groups including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria. Factors such as diet, antibiotics, age and stress shape the canine microbiome and can precipitate dysbiosis.

Cats are obligate carnivores with a microbiome adapted to protein- and fat-rich diets. Feline gut communities can be less diverse and are less well characterized in reference databases, which can make interpretation more challenging in clinical cases such as chronic vomiting or inflammatory bowel disease.

Clinical applications and interventions

Veterinary microbiome analysis is increasingly used to: evaluate chronic GI signs, support nutritional adjustments, identify microbial contributions to skin or ear problems, and guide the use of species-appropriate probiotics or prebiotics. Probiotic efficacy depends on strain specificity, viability and formulation; therefore, targeted recommendations informed by a microbial profile are preferable to generalized use.

Conclusion

Stool-based microbiome testing is a useful diagnostic adjunct for pets when combined with veterinary care. It can clarify contributors to chronic GI or dermatologic problems and support more individualized nutritional and probiotic strategies. Interpretation by a qualified clinician remains important to distinguish microbial signals from other medical causes and to determine appropriate next steps.
