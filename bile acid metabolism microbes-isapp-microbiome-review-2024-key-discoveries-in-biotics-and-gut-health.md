# ISAPP Microbiome Review 2024: Top Discoveries in Biotics and Beyond

The 2024 ISAPP microbiome review synthesizes several important advances that clarify how microbes and biotics influence human health. Recent studies refine our understanding of probiotics, prebiotics, bile acid metabolism, and microbial signatures that may aid early disease detection. This summary highlights evidence-based trends from the review and related research, focusing on mechanisms, clinical relevance, and emerging tools for monitoring the microbiome.

## Advances in probiotics and prebiotics

Research in 2024 continued to identify novel probiotic strains with distinct metabolic activities and immunomodulatory potential. Strain-level characterization is increasingly important: different strains within the same species can produce divergent metabolites, interact uniquely with the host immune system, and vary in survival through the gastrointestinal tract. Parallel work on prebiotics is expanding beyond traditional fibers to include targeted oligosaccharides that selectively nourish beneficial taxa, thereby enhancing community resilience.

A major shift is toward personalization. Population-level trials provide foundational efficacy data, but individualized approaches that account for baseline microbiome composition show improved response prediction. These findings support stratified interventions rather than one-size-fits-all formulations.

## Microbial markers and cancer detection

The review highlights reproducible associations between specific microbiome alterations and colorectal cancer, with some taxa enriched or depleted in early-stage disease. Combining microbial markers with traditional risk factors improves discriminatory models. While these signals are promising for non-invasive screening, prospective validation and standardized sampling/analysis pipelines are required before routine clinical application.

There is also mechanistic interest in how microbial metabolites influence carcinogenesis and immune surveillance. Certain bacteria can modulate inflammation and DNA damage pathways, suggesting possible roles for microbiome-directed prevention strategies pending rigorous clinical trials.

## Bile acid metabolism and microbial interactions

Microbes contribute to bile acid transformation, generating secondary bile acids that act as signaling molecules affecting metabolism and gut barrier function. The review details enzymatic pathways used by gut bacteria to deconjugate and dehydroxylate bile acids, with downstream effects on lipid digestion, glucose homeostasis, and inflammation. Disruptions in these pathways have been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic syndrome, indicating potential therapeutic targets in bile acid–microbe interactions.

## Tools and broader trends

Advances in sequencing, metabolomics, and computational methods—including AI and machine learning—are accelerating discovery. These tools enable integrative analyses that link taxa, genes, and metabolites to host phenotypes. Importantly, microbiome research is expanding beyond the gut to include skin, oral, and other body sites, revealing site-specific communities with systemic consequences.

Improved testing and monitoring approaches now offer higher-resolution profiles and faster turnaround, which facilitate longitudinal tracking and personalized recommendations.

## Conclusion

The ISAPP review underscores incremental but meaningful progress: strain-specific characterization, targeted prebiotics, microbial markers for early disease, and mechanistic links such as bile acid transformations. Continued emphasis on standardized methods and prospective validation will determine how these discoveries translate into clinical practice.
