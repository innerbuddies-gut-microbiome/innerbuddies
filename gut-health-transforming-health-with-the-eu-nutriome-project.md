## Introduction

Health is increasingly framed as the outcome of interacting biological, psychological, and environmental systems. One research initiative exploring this complexity is the EU NUTRIOME project, which investigates how diet and the microbiome interact to influence health. InnerBuddies (through its partner Genzai) contributes data-science and microbiome expertise to this effort, helping translate population-level insights into hypotheses for personalized nutrition and intervention strategies.

## What is NUTRIOME?

The NUTRIOME project, funded by the EU Horizon 2020 program, aims to map relationships between nutrition and the human microbiome, particularly in the gut. The project combines longitudinal cohorts, controlled dietary interventions, and multi-omic profiling to identify how specific foods, nutrients, and dietary patterns modulate microbial composition and function. Key objectives include elucidating mechanisms that link diet-driven microbiome changes to metabolic, immune, and neurobehavioral outcomes, and developing frameworks for precision nutrition.

The consortium includes universities, public health institutes, and industry partners. By integrating clinical data, metabolomics, and metagenomics, researchers aim to generate datasets that support personalized dietary recommendations and scalable public-health approaches for disease prevention.

## InnerBuddies / Genzai’s role

InnerBuddies contributes applied microbiome expertise and algorithmic approaches through its collaboration with Genzai, focusing on data integration and interpretation of microbiome–nutrition relationships. Their work supports the translation of research findings into testable nutritional strategies and diagnostic markers. Where appropriate, InnerBuddies intends to align product development and research hypotheses with insights generated by NUTRIOME, contributing to evidence-based approaches rather than promotional claims.

## Scientific and public-health implications

If the NUTRIOME consortium successfully links specific dietary components to reproducible microbiome shifts and downstream health effects, several outcomes are plausible:

- Improved mechanistic understanding of diet–microbiome–host interactions, which can inform targeted nutritional interventions.
- Development of biomarkers to stratify individuals by likely response to dietary changes, supporting precision nutrition research.
- Evidence to support population-level dietary recommendations that consider microbiome-mediated effects on metabolic and immune health.

These outcomes would not replace clinical judgment but could complement clinical and public-health strategies for preventing and managing chronic diseases.

## Conclusion

The EU NUTRIOME project represents a coordinated effort to integrate nutritional science with microbiome research. Contributions from partners such as InnerBuddies/Genzai aim to bridge computational analysis and translational application, strengthening the evidence base for personalized nutrition approaches. Ongoing results from NUTRIOME are expected to refine our understanding of how tailored dietary strategies may support metabolic, immune, and mental health outcomes.
