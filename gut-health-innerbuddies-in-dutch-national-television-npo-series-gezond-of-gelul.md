“Gezond of gelul?” is a Dutch television series that evaluates common health claims by testing them against available scientific evidence. The program aims to translate research findings into accessible information for the public while highlighting methodological strengths and limitations of individual studies. In its Gut Health Edition, the series examines claims about the gut microbiome, probiotics, diet, and the gut–brain axis — topics that have seen rapid growth in both research and consumer interest.

Format and approach

The show’s format focuses on evidence-based inquiry: presenters outline a claim, describe how they will test it, and consult domain experts such as microbiologists, clinicians, and nutrition scientists. Experiments, literature reviews, and consultations with specialists are used to evaluate whether a claim is supported by high-quality evidence. This structured approach helps viewers appreciate that single studies rarely provide definitive answers; the totality of evidence, study design, and reproducibility all matter.

Why the Gut Health Edition matters

Interest in the gut microbiome has surged because of promising research linking microbial communities to digestion, immunity, metabolic health, and mental well-being. However, much of the public discourse simplifies complex findings, often implying causal effects that the current evidence does not fully support. The Gut Health Edition aims to clarify which claims are supported by consistent clinical data and which remain speculative or preliminary.

InnerBuddies' role

InnerBuddies was featured in the Gut Health Edition as one of the products used to profile the gut microbiome. The program’s editor tested the InnerBuddies microbiome test as part of the episode’s exploration of how personalized gut profiling tools are used and interpreted. The segment discusses what microbiome tests typically measure, how reference databases and algorithms influence results, and the kinds of actionable insights that are currently supported by clinical research versus those that are still emerging.

Evidence-based perspective

Current evidence supports certain broad recommendations — for example, dietary diversity and fiber-rich foods tend to correlate with beneficial microbiome features in observational studies, and some probiotic strains show efficacy for specific clinical indications. However, personalized microbiome interventions remain an active area of research. The episode emphasizes the importance of peer-reviewed clinical trials, transparent reporting of methods, and cautious interpretation of individualized recommendations until they are validated in controlled studies.
