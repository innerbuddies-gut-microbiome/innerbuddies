Introduction

Interest in the gut microbiome has grown rapidly, and many people pursue stool-based tests to understand their gut bacterial composition. If you’re preparing for a test, it’s useful to know how everyday factors — especially pets and hygiene habits — can influence results and interpretation. For a general overview of this topic, see [Can Pets or Hygiene Affect My Gut Microbiome Test Results?](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/can-pets-hygiene-affect-gut-microbiome-test-results).

What microbiome tests measure

Most consumer and clinical gut microbiome tests analyze stool using DNA sequencing (16S rRNA or metagenomics) to profile which microbes are present and their relative abundances. These snapshots help assess diversity, presence of beneficial or potentially harmful taxa, and broad functional potential. Accuracy depends on sample quality, timing, and the absence of contaminating DNA introduced during collection.

How pets can influence your gut microbiome

Multiple studies indicate that cohabiting with animals, especially dogs, is associated with greater microbial richness in household members. Pet-associated microbes enter homes via fur, soil on paws, and direct contact; repeated exposure can increase taxonomic diversity in skin and gut communities. Early-life exposure appears particularly influential for immune development and microbial resilience.

For testing implications, short-term increases in contact (intense grooming, bathing, or cleaning after a pet) may slightly alter the microbes detected in a stool sample or introduce contamination if hands or collection surfaces aren’t clean. To reduce artifacts, avoid unusually close contact with pets immediately before sampling and follow hygiene steps during collection.

Hygiene practices and the hygiene hypothesis

Hygiene practices shape which microbes we encounter. The hygiene hypothesis posits that reduced microbial exposures, especially early in life, can affect immune training and increase susceptibility to allergic and autoimmune conditions. Excessive use of strong disinfectants or routine over-sterilization may reduce environmental microbial inputs that normally contribute to microbiome diversity.

That said, balanced hygiene remains important for preventing infection. For accurate testing, maintain your normal hygiene routine rather than dramatically increasing or decreasing cleaning in the days before collection.

Practical steps to improve test reliability

- Follow the kit instructions exactly for collection and storage to avoid contamination.
- Wash hands thoroughly before and after collecting the sample; avoid handling pets right before sampling.
- Avoid sampling during acute illness, within days of antibiotics, or immediately after major diet shifts or travel.
- If you live with animals, try to collect on a typical day (not after heavy grooming or household cleaning) to capture your usual baseline.
- Consider repeat testing over weeks or months to distinguish stable patterns from short-term variation.

Summary

Pets and hygiene practices can shape microbial exposures and thus influence gut microbiome composition. With careful sampling and by maintaining typical routines, you can reduce short-term artifacts and obtain a result that better reflects your usual gut ecology.
