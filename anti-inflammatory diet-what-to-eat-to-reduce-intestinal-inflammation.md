Managing intestinal inflammation through diet requires both general anti-inflammatory principles and microbiome-informed choices. This concise guide summarizes evidence-based foods and nutrients that support healing, reduce immune activation, and encourage a balanced gut ecosystem. For a full, detailed overview see [What to eat to reduce intestinal inflammation](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/what-to-eat-to-reduce-intestinal-inflammation).

Intestinal inflammation often arises from dysbiosis, pathogens, immune dysregulation, or barrier dysfunction. Testing the gut microbiome can reveal low diversity, reduced butyrate-producing species, or overgrowths of pro-inflammatory taxa; these findings help prioritize food-based interventions. Testing options such as <a href='https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test'>InnerBuddies microbiome test</a> provide data that can refine dietary plans without relying on broad generalizations.

Foundational practices for reducing inflammation focus on digestion and routine. Mindful eating, adequate hydration, regular meal timing, and minimizing ultra-processed foods create a baseline where therapeutic foods can be effective. Enzyme-containing foods (papaya, pineapple) and bitter greens (arugula, dandelion) can support breakdown of nutrients and bile flow, reducing irritation that perpetuates immune activation.

Gut-healing foods to prioritize
- Bone broth: supplies collagen, glutamine, and glycine to support mucosal repair.
- Fermented vegetables (kimchi, sauerkraut): introduce lactic acid bacteria that can increase diversity and support short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, though they should be introduced gradually if dysbiosis or SIBO is suspected.
- Resistant starches: cooled rice, lentils, plantains, and green bananas feed butyrate-producing microbes and promote colonic health.
- Polyphenol-rich plants: berries, pomegranate, and dark leafy greens support microbes like Akkermansia and reduce oxidative stress.

Targeted nutrients and supplements
- Omega-3 EPA/DHA: anti-inflammatory lipid mediators found in fatty fish and algae sources that modulate cytokine pathways.
- Specific probiotics: strains such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Saccharomyces boulardii have clinical evidence for reducing GI inflammation in particular contexts.
- Soluble and fermentable fiber: psyllium, inulin, and pectin encourage SCFA production and lower systemic inflammation markers.

Foods and compounds to limit
- Refined sugars, industrial seed oils, emulsifiers, and additives that alter microbial composition and increase intestinal permeability.
- Highly allergenic foods should be considered case-by-case; microbiome or biomarker testing can help identify problematic items rather than broad elimination.

Practical integration and monitoring
Rotate and diversify plant foods to foster microbial variety. Simple meal strategies—bone broth soups, fermented vegetable side dishes, polyphenol smoothies, and resistant-starch-containing sides—support consistent intake. Use re-testing intervals to evaluate shifts in microbial balance and inflammatory signals.

Conclusion: dietary changes that prioritize microbial diversity, SCFA production, mucosal repair, and targeted nutrients form the backbone of inflammation reduction. Microbiome-informed adjustments help tailor these general principles to individual needs and improve the likelihood of sustained intestinal wellness.
