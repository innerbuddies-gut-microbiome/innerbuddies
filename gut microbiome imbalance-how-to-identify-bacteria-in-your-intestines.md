# How can you tell if you have bacteria in your intestines?

Understanding whether intestinal bacteria are balanced or problematic is important for digestive and systemic health. Intestinal microbes perform digestion, synthesize some vitamins, regulate immunity, and influence mood; however, imbalances (dysbiosis), overgrowths, or infections can produce distinct patterns of symptoms and measurable changes in stool and breath testing. For an overview of the diagnostic approach, see [How to identify bacteria in your intestines](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/how-to-identify-bacteria-in-your-intestines).

## Common clinical signs

Symptoms alone cannot definitively prove the presence of harmful bacteria, but they help determine when testing is warranted. Digestive signs often include chronic bloating, excessive gas, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and changes in stool consistency. Overgrowth conditions such as SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth) frequently present with postprandial bloating, rapid fullness, and flatulence.

Non-digestive manifestations may point to microbial imbalance through the gut–brain and gut–immune axes: fatigue, brain fog, mood changes (anxiety or low mood), skin eruptions like acne or eczema, and recurrent infections due to altered immunity. When symptoms are persistent or unexplained by other causes, targeted testing can clarify whether bacteria are contributing.

## When infection is suspected

Acute severe symptoms—high fever, bloody stools, persistent vomiting, or signs of dehydration—raise concern for an infectious cause (bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal) and typically require prompt clinical evaluation. Common bacterial enteric pathogens include Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Clostridioides difficile. Laboratory stool testing or rapid molecular assays can identify specific pathogens and guide appropriate treatment.

## Laboratory approaches: what testing reveals

Modern stool-based microbiome testing uses DNA sequencing (16S rRNA or metagenomics), PCR, and antigen detection to profile microbial communities, detect pathogens, and estimate diversity and relative abundance. Breath tests measure hydrogen and methane to indicate bacterial fermentation in the small intestine (useful for diagnosing SIBO). Results commonly report diversity indices, proportions of major phyla, overrepresented taxa, and presence of known pathogens or opportunists.

## Interpreting results and next steps

Test results are most useful when combined with clinical history. Findings of low diversity, dominance of opportunistic taxa, detection of specific pathogens, or positive breath tests suggest different management strategies: targeted antimicrobials for infections, dietary and motility interventions for SIBO, and prebiotic/probiotic or dietary support to restore diversity in dysbiosis. Re-testing can document response.

Some at-home kits provide structured reports and recommendations; laboratory selection should prioritize validated methods and clinician interpretation rather than symptom-only self-treatment.

## Summary

Symptoms indicate when investigation is needed, but laboratory testing (stool DNA analysis, PCR, antigen assays, and breath tests) is required to identify pathogens, quantify overgrowth, and describe dysbiosis. Combining symptoms, validated testing, and clinical interpretation yields the most reliable assessment of intestinal bacterial status.
