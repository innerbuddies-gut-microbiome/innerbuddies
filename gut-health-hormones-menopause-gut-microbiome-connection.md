Introduction

Menopause represents a major endocrine transition that alters systemic physiology and the gut environment. Emerging evidence highlights bidirectional interactions between sex hormones and gut microbes: declining estrogen and progesterone influence gut permeability, immune function and motility, while the gut microbiome — particularly the estrobolome — affects estrogen recirculation and bioavailability.

Why the gut matters in menopause

The enterohepatic circulation of estrogens is a key mechanism linking gut microbes to systemic hormone levels. Conjugated estrogens excreted in bile can be deconjugated by bacterial β‑glucuronidase enzymes, releasing free estrogens available for reabsorption. Changes in microbial composition or enzyme activity therefore modulate circulating estrogen and downstream effects on bone, cardiovascular health and mood.

Hormonal effects on gut physiology

Estrogen supports intestinal barrier integrity via regulation of tight junction proteins; its decline is associated with increased intestinal permeability and low‑grade inflammation. Hormonal shifts also affect gut motility through interactions with serotonin signaling, contributing to altered bowel habits commonly reported in perimenopause and postmenopause. Immune modulation by sex steroids further shapes microbial community structure, producing a feed‑forward relationship between host hormones and the microbiome.

Key microbial players

Certain taxa and functions have been linked to estrogen metabolism and gut health in menopausal cohorts. Escherichia coli, Bacteroides and some Clostridium species express β‑glucuronidase activity relevant to estrogen deconjugation, while genera like Faecalibacterium, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium contribute to anti‑inflammatory signaling and barrier maintenance. Balanced activity is important: excessive β‑glucuronidase may increase estrogen recirculation, whereas low activity can reduce available estrogens.

Evidence snapshot

Recent studies report lower microbial diversity in many postmenopausal women, with shifts in taxa associated with secondary estrogen production and inflammation. Probiotic and fiber interventions have been shown to increase beneficial taxa (e.g., Bifidobacterium), reduce inflammatory markers, and in some trials modulate enzymes implicated in estrogen metabolism. While results are promising, heterogeneity across studies indicates the need for personalized assessment and further randomized trials.

Practical, evidence‑based strategies

Dietary fiber and prebiotics (inulin, FOS) support taxa involved in short‑chain fatty acid production and barrier health. Fermented foods and certain probiotic strains may help restore beneficial microbes, though strain‑specific effects are important to consider. Lifestyle factors — regular physical activity and stress reduction — also mitigate inflammation and support microbial diversity. In clinical contexts, hormone replacement therapy and targeted antimicrobial approaches may be appropriate, but require individualized medical guidance.

Conclusion

Menopause‑related hormonal shifts and the gut microbiome are tightly linked through multiple mechanisms including the enterohepatic estrogen pathway, immune modulation and barrier function. Evidence supports dietary, probiotic and lifestyle strategies to support gut health during this transition, though personalized approaches and continued research remain essential.
