Research collaborations that bridge academia, biotech and digital platforms can accelerate translation of microbiome science into actionable insights. A recent cooperation between InnerBuddies, Astrolab Biotecnología and Universidad EAFIT aims to do precisely that by integrating a research-grade Gut Microbiome Health Index (GMHI) into a consumer- and B2B-facing digital platform, while continuing joint scientific development.

Background: Universidad EAFIT and Astrolab

Universidad EAFIT in Medellín has an established program in applied biological sciences and microbiome research. Its research group CIBIOP (soon TechLIie) developed Biomatest, a diagnostic approach that combines metagenomic sequencing and metabolomic profiling to characterize gut microbial communities and their functional impact on host physiology. Publications from EAFIT researchers include metabolomic studies in pregnant and lactating populations that identify small-molecule signatures linked to diet, pharmacology and host metabolic status, illustrating how microbial metabolites can serve as biomarkers of health.

Astrolab Biotecnología, founded by EAFIT faculty, focuses on translating these research outputs into diagnostic and therapeutic tools for human and animal microbiomes. The company’s activities support both applied testing and the scientific validation of microbiome-informed interventions.

About the Gut Microbiome Health Index (GMHI)

The GMHI developed at EAFIT offers a composite metric based on microbial composition and diversity, supported by metagenomic and metabolomic data. The index is designed to summarize gut ecosystem status on a 0–100 scale to facilitate interpretation: higher scores indicate microbiome features typically associated with favorable metabolic, immune and digestive outcomes; lower scores reflect dysbiotic patterns correlated with conditions such as IBS, obesity and metabolic dysregulation. By combining taxonomic and functional signals, the GMHI aims to provide clinicians and researchers with a reproducible summary measure that can inform personalized nutrition and therapeutic decisions.

Cooperation and platform integration

Under the agreement, the next version of Biomatest will be implemented on the InnerBuddies platform, enabling features such as personalized nutrition guidance, food-diary-informed recommendations, and suggestions for targeted prebiotic or probiotic approaches. InnerBuddies will integrate the GMHI so it becomes accessible to Astrolab customers and to other B2B clients worldwide. The partners will also pursue joint scientific innovation, clinical trials and publications to validate and refine the GMHI and related interventions.

Timeline and availability

The integrated GMHI is planned to be available to InnerBuddies users in March 2025 as adult and youth (under-18) versions, offering a standardized numeric readout alongside interpretive reporting. The cooperative model emphasizes evidence generation: platform-enabled deployment will be accompanied by research efforts led by Astrolab and EAFIT to evaluate clinical validity and utility.
