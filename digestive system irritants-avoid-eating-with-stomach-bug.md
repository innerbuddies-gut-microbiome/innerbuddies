A stomach bug (viral gastroenteritis) commonly causes nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping and diarrhea. Dietary choices during the acute phase can influence symptom severity and the speed of recovery because they affect hydration, intestinal irritation, and the gut microbiome. This article summarizes foods to avoid, explains why they can worsen illness, and points to resources for individualizing recovery.

## Why food choices matter

A viral attack can temporarily disrupt digestive enzymes and the balance of intestinal bacteria. Foods that are hard to digest, inflammatory, or osmotic in the gut can prolong diarrhea, increase gas and bloating, or delay mucosal healing. Conversely, bland, low-fat, low-fiber options reduce mechanical stress and help restore electrolyte balance while the microbiome re-establishes itself.

## Foods to avoid and why

- Dairy: Many people develop temporary lactase deficiency after intestinal infections. Unabsorbed lactose can ferment in the colon, worsening gas and diarrhea.
- Fried and high-fat foods: These slow gastric emptying and require more digestive work, increasing nausea and abdominal discomfort.
- High insoluble-fiber items: Raw vegetables, nuts, seeds and certain whole grains can mechanically irritate the inflamed intestine and accelerate stool output.
- Sugary drinks and sweets: Simple sugars create an osmotic load that draws water into the gut and can feed fermentation-prone bacteria, intensifying diarrhea.
- Artificial sweeteners (e.g., sorbitol): Poorly absorbed sugar alcohols commonly exacerbate loose stools and gas.
- Spicy and acidic foods: Foods rich in capsaicin or acid may impair mucosal recovery and increase reflux or pain.
- Caffeine and alcohol: Both dehydrate and can increase gut motility and inflammation.

## Practical feeding approach

Begin with small, frequent amounts of clear fluids (electrolyte solutions when available) and transition to bland, low-fiber foods as tolerated: plain rice, toast, applesauce, mashed banana, and broths. Reintroduce more complex foods slowly and monitor tolerance.

Consider microbiome-centered resources when symptoms persist or are recurrent.

## When to seek care

If you have high fever, severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, signs of dehydration, bloody stools, or symptoms lasting more than a few days, seek medical evaluation. For most uncomplicated cases, careful dietary management and hydration support symptom resolution.

Summary: avoid dairy, greasy foods, high insoluble fiber, concentrated sugars, artificial sweeteners, spicy foods, caffeine and alcohol while your gut heals. Reintroduce foods gradually and consider microbiome-informed guidance for recurrent or prolonged recovery.
