# H. pylori Stool Antigen Test: A Non-Invasive Option for Stomach Infection

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a common bacterium that can colonize the stomach lining and, if persistent, contribute to peptic ulcers and increased gastric cancer risk. Many infected people are asymptomatic, while others report recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, or dyspepsia. Accurate diagnosis is important for appropriate clinical management and surveillance.

## What the stool antigen test detects

The stool antigen test identifies H. pylori proteins (antigens) shed in feces, which makes it a direct marker of active infection. Compared with serology, which can remain positive after eradication, the stool antigen test better reflects current bacterial presence. It is also an alternative to the urea breath test and endoscopic biopsy-based methods when non-invasive assessment is preferred.

## Advantages and limitations

Advantages of the stool antigen test include its non-invasive nature, relative ease of sample collection at home, and good sensitivity and specificity in many clinical studies when performed with validated assays. It is widely used for both initial diagnosis and post-treatment confirmation of eradication.

Limitations to consider: test accuracy can be affected by recent use of antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), or bismuth compounds, which may reduce bacterial load and yield false-negative results. Current guidelines typically recommend stopping antibiotics and bismuth at least 4 weeks and PPIs at least 2 weeks before testing when clinically feasible. Additionally, pre-analytical handling and the specific assay used can influence results.

## When to consider testing

Consider testing for H. pylori in patients with persistent dyspeptic symptoms, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, or a personal or family history of peptic ulcer disease or gastric cancer. The stool antigen test is also appropriate for confirming eradication after therapy once interfering medications have been discontinued for the recommended interval.

An evidence-informed diagnostic pathway often balances clinical presentation, non-invasive testing (stool antigen or urea breath test), and invasive evaluation (endoscopy with biopsy) when alarm features or complications are suspected.

## Treatment implications and follow-up

When H. pylori infection is confirmed, current standard approaches involve combination antibiotic regimens plus acid suppression to promote eradication and mucosal healing. Local antibiotic resistance patterns and prior treatment history inform regimen selection. After completing therapy, retesting with a non-invasive method such as the stool antigen test (or urea breath test) is recommended to verify eradication.

## Practical notes

Clinicians and patients should discuss medication timing, test selection, and follow-up plans. The stool antigen test is a useful tool in the diagnostic toolbox for H. pylori when used in the appropriate clinical context and with attention to known pre-test variables that influence accuracy.
