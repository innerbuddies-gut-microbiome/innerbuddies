Introduction

Gut microbiome tests analyze stool samples to profile the microbes living in the gastrointestinal tract. Results often report diversity, relative abundances of bacterial groups, and functional markers such as short‑chain fatty acids (SCFAs). While diet and medications are well‑recognized influences, physical activity is an important and sometimes overlooked factor that can alter the microbial snapshot captured by a test.

What the evidence shows

Human and animal studies indicate that regular, moderate exercise is associated with increased microbial diversity and higher levels of SCFA‑producing bacteria such as Faecalibacterium and Akkermansia. A 2014 comparison of athletes and non‑athletes reported greater diversity and butyrate production among athletes; intervention trials (e.g., Allen et al., 2018) show that previously sedentary adults can experience shifts in microbiota and SCFA levels after weeks of aerobic training. Conversely, extreme endurance activity or prolonged intense training—especially when combined with dehydration or caloric restriction—can increase gut permeability and transiently reduce diversity.

Short‑term vs. long‑term effects

Exercise can induce both acute and chronic changes. Acute, high‑intensity sessions may temporarily alter gut motility, pH, and inflammatory markers, potentially changing test metrics for hours to days. Chronic, consistent activity tends to produce more stable shifts toward beneficial taxa and metabolic outputs. This distinction matters: a microbiome test taken immediately after a new intensive training block may reflect transient perturbations rather than baseline status.

Can exercise skew your test results?

Yes—particularly if there are recent, large changes in activity. Sudden increases in training load, an ultramarathon, or a week of unusually hard workouts can elevate inflammatory markers, change transit time, and shift microbial metabolites. These are valid biological signals but may not represent your typical gut ecosystem. To interpret results accurately, labs and clinicians often recommend sampling under usual lifestyle conditions.

Practical guidance for testing

- Avoid abrupt changes to your exercise routine in the 7 days before collecting a sample.  
- Postpone testing shortly after extreme endurance events or periods of heavy training.  
- Maintain usual diet, hydration, sleep, and supplement use when possible.  
- Discuss recent training changes with the testing provider or clinician to contextualize results.

Bi‑directional relationship

Importantly, the relationship is two‑way: the microbiome can influence exercise performance and recovery via metabolites like SCFAs and taxa such as Veillonella that metabolize lactate. This interaction reinforces the value of interpreting microbiome data in the context of training history and goals.

Conclusion

Exercise influences the gut microbiome, and recent or extreme activity can change test results. For an accurate baseline assessment, aim to sample during a typical training week and communicate recent exercise history to the testing service or clinician. For ongoing monitoring, repeated tests under consistent conditions provide the most informative trends.
