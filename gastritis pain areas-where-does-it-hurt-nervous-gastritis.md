Many people with stomach discomfort, bloating, or upper abdominal pain ask whether anxiety or emotional stress can be the cause. Nervous gastritis—often described as a “nervous stomach” or functional dyspepsia—refers to symptom patterns where psychological stress manifests as inflammation, irritation, or heightened sensitivity in the stomach. This article explains typical pain locations, the gut–brain mechanisms involved, and how microbiome evaluation can help clarify causes.

Where it hurts

Pain from nervous gastritis is most commonly felt in the epigastric region: the upper-central abdomen just below the sternum. Some people report burning, pressure, or tightness across the upper abdomen that can radiate to the ribs or into the back. Others experience central abdominal bloating or cramping. The variability reflects differences in visceral sensitivity, motility changes, and which portions of the digestive tract are most affected by inflammation or dysbiosis.

Why the brain and gut are linked

The gut–brain axis is a bidirectional network connecting the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system. Stress activates the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and increases cortisol, which can alter gastric acid secretion, mucosal defenses, and motility. Concurrently, shifts in the gut microbiome can amplify visceral hypersensitivity: microbial metabolites and inflammatory signals sensitize afferent nerves and modify vagus nerve signaling, changing how pain is perceived.

Microbiome patterns and pain location

Emerging evidence links certain microbial patterns to symptom clusters. Overgrowth of gas-producing or fermenting bacteria may present primarily as bloating and central discomfort, while increases in proinflammatory taxa can associate with sharper, persistent upper abdominal pain. Loss of butyrate‑producing and mucosa‑protective species may predispose the upper stomach lining to irritation and localized epigastric symptoms.

Diagnostic value of testing

For people with persistent symptoms and no obvious structural cause, microbiome testing can map bacterial composition and diversity, suggesting whether dysbiosis might contribute. Results that show low diversity, decreased protective species, or enrichment of inflammatory taxa can guide noninvasive strategies such as dietary adjustments, targeted prebiotics or probiotics, and interventions aimed at restoring mucosal health.

Linking anxiety, motility, and digestion

Anxiety often reduces digestive efficiency—lower acid output, slowed gastric emptying, and altered enzyme secretion—creating conditions favorable to bacterial overgrowth and fermentation. This can produce early satiety, burping, and the sensation of food “stuck” in the stomach. Integrative approaches that address both stress regulation and microbiome composition show the most promise for long‑term symptom reduction.
