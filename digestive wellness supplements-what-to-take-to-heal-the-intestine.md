Intestinal healing supports digestion, immune function, and overall wellbeing. Effective strategies combine diagnostic insight, targeted supplements, and dietary changes designed to reduce inflammation and restore microbial balance. This article summarizes evidence-based steps to support intestinal repair and highlights tools that can help personalize care.

Gut microbiome assessment is a useful starting point because it reveals patterns of dysbiosis, low diversity, or pathogenic overgrowth that can perpetuate inflammation. For an overview of testing and interpretation, see this detailed resource on <a href='https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/unlocking-gut-health-secrets-microbiome-tests-guide'>microbiome testing and what it reveals</a>. Regular retesting (for example, every 3–6 months) can track responses to interventions and guide adjustments.

Diagnostic information supports targeted interventions. For many people, a combination of probiotics, prebiotics, and specific nutritive supplements can reduce permeability and encourage mucosal repair. Probiotics containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains, and yeast strains such as Saccharomyces boulardii, have been associated with symptom reductions in IBS and with improvements in gut barrier markers. Prebiotic fibers—like inulin and fructooligosaccharides—promote short-chain fatty acid production (notably butyrate), which nourishes colonocytes and supports epithelial integrity.

Supplement choices should be matched to clinical context. L-glutamine serves as a primary fuel for enterocytes and has been used in trials addressing gut permeability; typical supplemental doses in clinical protocols range from 5–10 g per day, taken on an empty stomach. Zinc carnosine has evidence for mucosal protection and is often considered in cases of NSAID-related gut injury. Digestive enzyme formulas may assist individuals with malabsorption or persistent bloating by improving macronutrient breakdown. Mucilaginous botanicals—slippery elm, marshmallow root, and aloe vera—offer symptomatic soothing properties and may reduce mucosal irritation.

Dietary patterns are central to microbiome restoration. A diet rich in diverse fibers (vegetables, legumes, whole grains), fermented foods (kefir, sauerkraut, tempeh), and omega‑3 sources (fatty fish, flaxseed) tends to support microbial diversity and lower systemic inflammation. Removing or reducing processed foods, excess sugar, and industrial seed oils can decrease proinflammatory signaling that impedes repair.

Personalization matters: not all interventions suit every patient. For example, prebiotics can exacerbate symptoms in some people with SIBO, and high‑dose probiotics may be contraindicated in select immunocompromised individuals. Where possible, pair interventions with diagnostic data and professional oversight. Further practical testing options include at‑home services such as <a href='https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test'>InnerBuddies Microbiome Test</a>, which can inform tailored protocols.
