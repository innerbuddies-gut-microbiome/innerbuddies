# How to treat intestinal dysbiosis?

Intestinal dysbiosis is an imbalance in the gut microbial community that can contribute to digestive symptoms, immune dysregulation, metabolic changes, and even mood alterations. This concise, evidence-based overview outlines causes, detection methods, and practical strategies to restore microbial balance using testing, diet, targeted supplements, and lifestyle measures.

## Causes and detection

Dysbiosis commonly follows antibiotic exposure, high processed-sugar diets, chronic stress, infections, or impaired gut motility. Symptoms range from bloating, gas, constipation, and diarrhea to extra-intestinal signs such as fatigue, brain fog, skin problems, and mood shifts. Objective detection is accomplished through stool-based microbiome assays and targeted tests for conditions like small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).

## Interpreting testing and tailoring treatment

Modern sequencing tests (16S rRNA, metagenomics) and specialized stool analyses provide information on bacterial composition, pathogen presence, and inflammatory markers. Interpreting those results in context—symptoms, medication history, and diet—allows clinicians to select targeted interventions rather than relying on generic recommendations. Follow-up testing 3–6 months after an intervention helps assess progress and refine the approach.

## Therapeutic strategies

1. Antimicrobial control when indicated: For confirmed overgrowth or specific pathogens, short courses of targeted antimicrobials (pharmaceutical or evidence-backed botanical agents) are sometimes necessary. Choice and duration should be based on diagnostic data.

2. Probiotics and prebiotics: Use strain-specific probiotics supported by trial data for the indicated condition (for example, certain Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains for IBS-related symptoms). Prebiotic fibers (inulin, oligosaccharides) can selectively feed beneficial taxa, but should be introduced gradually to mitigate gas and bloating.

3. Diet and fermentable substrates: A diet emphasizing diverse, fiber-rich whole foods supports bacterial diversity. Fermented foods can provide live microbes; polyphenol-rich foods (berries, tea) support beneficial species. In cases of SIBO or severe fermentative symptoms, short-term dietary modifications may be necessary under guidance.

4. Mucosal support and nutrients: Nutrients such as L-glutamine, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D have evidence for supporting barrier integrity and reducing mucosal inflammation.

5. Lifestyle: Stress management, adequate sleep, and regular physical activity influence gut motility and microbial composition and should be part of a comprehensive plan.

6. Advanced options: For refractory, severe dysbiosis (notably recurrent C. difficile), fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has demonstrated efficacy in specific contexts; ongoing research is evaluating broader applications.

## Monitoring and prognosis

Recovery timelines vary: some patients improve within weeks, while complex cases may require months of phased care and retesting. Objective monitoring, symptom tracking, and iterative adjustments based on follow-up tests improve outcomes and help prevent recurrence.

For practitioners and patients seeking testing options, a stool-based microbiome test can provide actionable data (<a href='https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test'>microbiome test</a>). A methodical, personalized approach grounded in diagnostics offers the best chance to rebalance gut flora and restore intestinal health.
