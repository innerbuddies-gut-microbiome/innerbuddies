An unhealthy gut can affect digestion, immunity, mood, and metabolic health. Restoring balance requires identifying the underlying drivers of dysbiosis, removing or reducing disruptive factors, and rebuilding a diverse microbial community. This article summarizes evidence-based steps—beginning with assessment and moving through targeted interventions—to help guide a practical, personalized approach.

## Start with assessment: identify dysbiosis

Evaluation is the first step. Stool-based gut microbiome testing provides information on microbial composition, pathogen presence, inflammatory markers, and functional outputs (for example, short-chain fatty acid production). Interpreting these data helps prioritize interventions instead of relying on generic protocols.

## Remove or reduce drivers of imbalance

Address factors that promote harmful microbes or injure the gut barrier. Common contributors include long-term antibiotics, diets high in refined sugars and processed fats, chronic stress, and environmental toxins. Dietary elimination of highly processed foods and a short-term reduction in high-FODMAP or high-histamine items (when indicated by testing or symptoms) can reduce fermentative stress and inflammation. Detox strategies should be conservative and data-driven to avoid worsening dysbiosis or provoking strong die-off reactions.

## Targeted antimicrobial or antimicrobial-herbal steps (when indicated)

When testing identifies specific pathogenic overgrowths—such as certain proteobacteria, yeast, or parasites—therapies can be selected to reduce those organisms. Options include targeted antibiotics in clinical settings or evidence-based herbal antimicrobials. Follow-up testing is important to confirm reduction and to guide subsequent restorative steps.

## Repair the gut barrier

Intestinal permeability ('leaky gut') often coexists with dysbiosis. Nutrients with supportive evidence for mucosal repair include L-glutamine, collagen or gelatin, zinc, and certain polyphenols. Gradual reintroduction of fiber and avoidance of dietary triggers help prevent renewed irritation. Managing systemic inflammation through sleep, stress reduction, and avoidance of pro-inflammatory foods supports barrier healing.

## Rebuild microbial diversity

Long-term recovery focuses on creating ecological niches for beneficial microbes. Key components include:

- Prebiotic fibers and resistant starches (for example, oats, cooked-and-cooled potatoes, green banana flour) to feed butyrate-producing bacteria.
- Fermented foods and, when appropriate based on testing, targeted probiotic strains to supplement missing taxa.
- Diets rich in polyphenols (berries, tea, olive oil) that selectively enrich beneficial organisms.

Evidence supports iterative re-testing to assess changes in diversity and function rather than assuming a fixed timeline; many people show measurable improvement in months, while more complex cases can take longer.

## Practical monitoring and context

Travel, medication changes, and lifestyle shifts can alter microbiome test results; consider these factors when interpreting longitudinal data. For a discussion about travel-related effects on testing, review: <a href='https://telegra.ph/Can-Traveling-Affect-Your-Gut-Microbiome-Test-Results-12-23'>Can Traveling Affect Your Gut Microbiome Test Results?</a> and experiential notes from repeat-testing scenarios: <a href='https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/traveling-gut-microbiome-test-results'>Traveling and gut microbiome test results</a>.

For those using precision strategies, a validated at-home sequencing test can provide actionable data to tailor interventions (for example, a specific <a href='https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test'>microbiome test</a>). Overall, clearing an unhealthy gut is a staged process—assess, remove drivers, repair the barrier, and rebuild microbial diversity—guided by objective testing and conservative, evidence-informed interventions.
