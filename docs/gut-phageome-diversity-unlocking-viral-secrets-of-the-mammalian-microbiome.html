The mammalian gut hosts not only bacteria but also a complex viral community known as the gut phageome. These viruses—predominantly bacteriophages that infect bacteria—play a central role in shaping microbial ecology, influencing digestion, immune function, and the stability of microbial communities. Recent viral metagenomics studies are beginning to illuminate the breadth and function of this hidden virome.

## What is the gut phageome?

Definition and role

The gut phageome comprises viruses present in the digestive tract, with bacteriophages being the most abundant and ecologically impactful. Phages interact directly with bacterial hosts, mediating population dynamics through lytic cycles (killing host cells) or lysogenic relationships (integrating into host genomes). These interactions can alter community composition, horizontal gene transfer, and metabolic capabilities.

Importance in mammalian gut microbiome

In mammals, phage–bacteria interactions contribute to microbial homeostasis. By regulating bacterial abundance and diversity, phages help prevent dominance by opportunistic taxa and support a resilient microbial network that underpins digestion, nutrient absorption, and mucosal immunity.

## Exploring viral diversity in the gut

Microbiome virome study techniques

Advances in viral metagenomics and computational viromics enable researchers to recover viral genomes from stool and gut tissue samples, annotate functions, and infer host–virus relationships. These techniques reveal a high degree of novelty: many gut viruses lack close relatives in reference databases, indicating a largely uncharted viral diversity.

Types of viruses in the gut

While bacteriophages are dominant, other eukaryotic viruses can be detected, though their roles are less well understood. Phage diversity includes tailed Caudovirales, inoviruses, and ssDNA phages; their life-history strategies influence how they shape bacterial communities under different environmental pressures.

## Bacteriophages and their ecological roles

What are bacteriophages?

Phages are viruses that infect bacteria and can modulate microbial function through predation, transduction (gene transfer), and by selecting for phage-resistant bacterial variants. These processes can alter metabolic pathways and influence host health indirectly.

Influence on gut microbial communities

Selective pressure from phages can maintain microbial diversity by preventing single-species overgrowth (the “kill-the-winner” dynamic) and by promoting genetic exchange. Phage-mediated gene transfer can disseminate traits such as antibiotic resistance or metabolic functions, with implications for community resilience and host–microbe interactions.

## Insights from virome research and health relevance

Viral metagenomics studies show that gut phageomes are dynamic and personalized: phage composition varies between individuals and responds to diet, antibiotics, and disease states. Disruptions in phage diversity have been associated with inflammatory and metabolic conditions in observational studies, though causal mechanisms remain an active area of research.

## Conclusion

Gut phageome diversity is a fundamental but understudied component of the mammalian microbiome. Continued viromics research will improve understanding of how viral communities contribute to microbial balance, host physiology, and disease risk, informing future diagnostics and therapeutic strategies grounded in ecological and mechanistic evidence.
