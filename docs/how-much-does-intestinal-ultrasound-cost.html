Intestinal ultrasound is a non-invasive, radiation-free modality that helps visualize bowel wall thickness, motility, and signs of inflammation—information that can complement stool-based microbiome testing and clinical assessment.</p>

<h2>Typical Price Ranges and What Drives Cost</h2>
<p>In the United States, an intestinal ultrasound performed without insurance usually ranges from about $250 to $600. Broader gastrointestinal (GI) ultrasounds that include the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder often cost more—roughly $400 to $1,200—because of increased scan time and interpretation complexity. Abdominal ultrasound exams commonly fall between $200 and $500, while advanced bowel imaging modalities (CT enterography or MR enterography) can run from $500 to $2,000 depending on contrast use and facility type.</p>

<p>Factors that influence pricing include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Geographic location and local market rates</li>
  <li>Facility type (hospital vs. outpatient imaging center)</li>
  <li>Expertise of the interpreting physician</li>
  <li>Urgency and scheduling (same-day or weekend service may incur premiums)</li>
  <li>Use of contrast agents or additional procedures such as guided biopsies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Insurance, Coding, and Cost-Saving Questions</h2>
<p>Insurance coverage varies: diagnostic imaging ordered by a clinician and tied to clinical indications is more likely to be reimbursed. Ask your provider for CPT codes and an itemized estimate to submit for pre-authorization or reimbursement. Health savings accounts (HSA) and flexible spending accounts (FSA) may also cover eligible diagnostic imaging.</p>

<p>To reduce expenses, consider outpatient imaging centers, request digital reports, and compare cash prices. If combining imaging with stool DNA sequencing, look for coordinated packages at diagnostic centers that align imaging timing with microbiome sampling to avoid redundant appointments.</p>

<h2>When More Advanced Imaging Is Warranted</h2>
<p>Advanced bowel imaging becomes relevant for symptoms such as persistent weight loss, chronic diarrhea, suspected strictures, or a family history of inflammatory bowel disease or colorectal cancer. These modalities are costlier but provide higher diagnostic yield when structural issues are suspected.</p>

<h2>Global Pricing and Practical Considerations</h2>
<p>In some countries, routine GI imaging may be considerably less expensive, but quality, reporting standards, and follow-up logistics should be carefully evaluated. When using microbiome data alongside imaging, interpret findings in an integrated clinical context rather than in isolation.</p>
