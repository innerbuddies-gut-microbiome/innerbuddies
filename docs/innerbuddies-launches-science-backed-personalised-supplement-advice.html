The offering is positioned as an evidence-informed method to align specific probiotic strains and prebiotic foods with each person's gut microbiome profile and stated health objectives.

Background and rationale

Research into the gut microbiome increasingly supports the idea that responses to dietary interventions and supplements are person-specific. Differences in microbial composition, diversity, and functional potential can influence how an individual metabolizes prebiotic fibres or responds to particular probiotic strains. A personalised strategy seeks to reduce guesswork by matching interventions to measurable features of an individual's microbiome and to documented clinical evidence for specific strains and outcomes.

Evidence-based features

The service emphasises several evidence-related elements commonly recommended in scientific guidance on microbiome-targeted interventions:

- Use of probiotic strains with peer-reviewed, strain-specific evidence for defined outcomes rather than generic species-level claims.
- Integration of personal health objectives so recommendations are relevant to targeted functions (for example, digestion-related symptoms, metabolic markers or immune support) when evidence exists.
- Expert curation, including literature review and scoring of evidence quality for recommended strains.
- A food-first orientation, prioritising prebiotic-rich foods as the primary means to nurture beneficial microbes, with supplements suggested as complementary where indicated.
- Transparency about the rationale for each recommendation, including limitations and safety considerations.

How the process functions

Participants complete a gut microbiome test and provide information on health goals. The microbial profile is analysed to characterise diversity, relative abundance of key taxa, and other microbiome features. Recommendations are then customised: prebiotic food suggestions focus on fermentable fibres suited to the individual's profile, while probiotic advice highlights strains that have been validated for the stated objectives and that are supported by a documented evidence score.

Limitations and considerations

Personalised microbiome guidance is not a substitute for clinical medical advice. Evidence for many probiotic applications remains mixed or limited to specific populations and conditions; strain specificity matters, and not all strains within a species confer the same effects. Prebiotic responses also vary and can transiently alter symptoms such as bloating in some individuals. The approach is most robust when it combines microbiome data with clinical context and is transparent about evidence strength.

The scientific and practical value of personalised supplement advice depends on transparent reporting of methods, careful curation of strain-level evidence, and consideration of individual clinical circumstances. A measured, food-first framework with documented evidence assessments can help users and practitioners interpret microbiome-informed recommendations responsibly.
