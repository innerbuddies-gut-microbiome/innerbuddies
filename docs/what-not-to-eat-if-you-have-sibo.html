Dietary management focuses on reducing rapidly fermentable substrates that feed these bacteria while supporting digestion and gradual microbial rebalancing.</p>

<h2>Key food groups to avoid during active SIBO</h2>

<p>High-FODMAP foods are common triggers because they are poorly absorbed and readily fermented. Typical offenders include garlic and onions, wheat and rye, many stone fruits and apples, and legumes such as lentils and chickpeas. A structured low-FODMAP elimination followed by systematic reintroduction helps identify individual tolerances.</p>

<p>Fermented foods, although beneficial for many people, can aggravate active SIBO by introducing additional live microbes and residual fermentable substrates. Items like sauerkraut, kimchi, kombucha, yogurt and kefir may increase gas and bloating for some patients until the overgrowth is controlled.</p>

<p>Processed snacks and convenience foods often contain refined starches, maltodextrin and additives (emulsifiers, preservatives) that can promote dysbiosis and feed opportunistic bacteria. These hidden ingredients are not always captured by FODMAP lists, so careful label reading is important.</p>

<p>Artificial sweeteners and certain sugar alcohols are another risk. Compounds such as sorbitol, xylitol and mannitol (polyols) are fermentable and commonly used in “sugar-free” foods; sucralose and saccharin have also been associated with negative shifts in microbial composition in experimental studies.</p>

<p>Lactose-containing dairy products can cause symptoms when lactase activity is impaired or when SIBO-related inflammation reduces enzymatic function. Milk, soft cheeses and ice cream are frequent triggers, while some hard, aged cheeses and lactose-free options may be better tolerated.</p>

<h2>Using testing and data to personalize choices</h2>

<p>Because individual microbiomes vary, microbiome analysis can inform targeted dietary strategies. A stool-based <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">gut microbiome test</a> can reveal species imbalances, indicators of inflammation, and metabolic potential that influence which fermentable foods are most problematic for you.</p>

<p>For practical help with phased reintroduction and dietary diversity, resources like the <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/30-plant-challenge-boost-your-microbiome-diversity-with-plant-powered-foods">30-Plant Challenge</a> show how to diversify tolerated foods safely over time. For deeper methodological context on how microbial function is measured, see an explanation of how laboratories <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/how-innerbuddies-measures-your-microbiome-s-metabolic-potential-personalized-gut-insights">measure metabolic potential</a>.</p>

<p>Additional background on analytic approaches is available in an overview article <a href="https://telegra.ph/How-InnerBuddies-Measures-Your-Microbiomes-Metabolic-Potential-12-21">describing metabolic potential assessment</a>, which can help interpret why some substrates trigger symptoms while others do not.</p>

<h2>Practical guidance</h2>

<p>During active SIBO: minimize high-FODMAP foods, avoid fermented and probiotic-rich products that exacerbate symptoms, limit processed snacks and hidden additives, and steer clear of fermentable sweeteners and lactose until symptoms improve. Use testing and methodical reintroduction to broaden your diet safely.
