<p>The intestine naturally contains trillions of bacteria that contribute to digestion, immune defence, vitamin production and communication with the nervous system. Determining whether bacteria are present is trivial—the gut is normally colonized—but distinguishing a healthy microbial community from imbalance or infection requires targeted assessment. This article summarizes evidence-based ways to detect bacterial presence, imbalance, overgrowth and infection, and explains what common tests reveal.</p>

<h2>Clinical signs that suggest bacterial imbalance or infection</h2>

<p>Symptoms alone cannot definitively identify bacterial status, but they guide testing. Persistent bloating, abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea or constipation, unexplained fatigue, recurrent infections, food sensitivities, and certain skin conditions often correlate with altered gut microbiota (dysbiosis) or overgrowth. Acute onset of fever, bloody stools, severe cramps or dehydration raises concern for an intestinal bacterial infection and warrants prompt clinical evaluation.</p>

<h2>Laboratory methods for detecting intestinal bacteria</h2>

<p>Modern diagnostics combine traditional and molecular approaches. Stool culture can identify many enteric pathogens, but culture has limits for low-abundance or fastidious organisms. Molecular stool sequencing—such as 16S rRNA profiling or whole genome sequencing—directly detects bacterial DNA and provides a community-level profile. Breath tests measuring hydrogen and methane are used clinically to detect small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Inflammatory markers (e.g., fecal calprotectin) and tests for specific toxins (e.g., C. difficile toxin assays) complement microbial detection when infection or inflammation is suspected.</p>

<h2>Interpreting microbiome and SIBO results</h2>

<p>Microbiome reports typically include relative abundance of taxa, diversity indices, and flags for known pathogens or antibiotic resistance genes. Lower diversity and reduced levels of beneficial genera—like Bifidobacterium or Faecalibacterium—can indicate dysbiosis. Breath tests that show early or elevated hydrogen/methane production after ingesting a simple carbohydrate suggest SIBO. It is important that results are interpreted in clinical context; asymptomatic deviations from population averages do not always require treatment.</p>

<h2>When to test and what to expect</h2>

<p>Testing is useful when symptoms are persistent, when infection is suspected after travel or antibiotic use, or when targeted therapy is being considered.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Presence of bacteria in the intestine is normal; the clinical question is whether the community is balanced. Combining symptom assessment with targeted lab tests—stool sequencing, breath testing, cultures and inflammatory markers—provides the most accurate picture. Results should be interpreted with clinical input to guide appropriate dietary, microbial or medical interventions.</p>
