Scientific research increasingly distinguishes between microbes that support health, those associated with disease, and taxa that can be beneficial in some contexts but harmful in others.

The Good

Beneficial microbes contribute to nutrient breakdown, vitamin production, and competitive exclusion of pathogens. Key genera include Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Akkermansia and Faecalibacterium. Bifidobacteria are abundant in infants and help metabolize human milk oligosaccharides, creating an environment less hospitable to pathogens. Lactobacilli are widely used as probiotics and can support gut and vaginal health; their effects are strain-dependent and linked to outcomes such as reduced diarrhoea or improvements in some inflammatory conditions. Akkermansia muciniphila, a mucin-degrading bacterium, has been associated with improved metabolic markers in some studies. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii produces butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that supports gut barrier integrity and has been correlated with lower rates of inflammatory disorders.

The Bad

Some bacteria are consistently associated with disease processes. Fusobacterium species, notably F. nucleatum, have been found enriched in colorectal carcinoma tissues and are implicated in tumor progression and immune modulation, although causality remains under investigation. Certain Clostridium species can contribute to gut dysfunction: Clostridium difficile can cause severe, sometimes life-threatening colitis after antibiotic disruption of the microbiome, and other Clostridia have been linked to visceral hypersensitivity, inflammation, and metabolic metabolites (e.g., trimethylamine-N-oxide) associated with cardiovascular risk.

The Ugly

A subset of genera display context-dependent effects. Alistipes and Parabacteroides are examples where literature reports both protective and detrimental associations. Alistipes has been linked to protective effects in liver fibrosis and some cancer therapy contexts, yet other studies associate it with colorectal cancer risk and depressive symptoms. Parabacteroides can exert anti-inflammatory effects in some models but has also been isolated from abdominal infections and linked to pro-inflammatory outcomes in other studies. These mixed findings highlight that microbial function is shaped by community context, host factors, diet and environment.

Implications and next steps

Understanding which bacteria populate an individual’s gut can inform observational and interventional research, but translating associations into clinical recommendations requires careful evidence synthesis. Microbial taxa act within complex ecosystems; single-species labels (good/bad) are simplifications that can guide inquiry but should not substitute for mechanistic and clinical studies.
