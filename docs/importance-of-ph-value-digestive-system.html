This article summarizes the key roles of pH across the digestive tract and practical ways to support balanced acidity and alkalinity.

## pH: a biological regulator

pH measures acidity or alkalinity on a 0–14 scale. Small shifts in pH can alter protein shape and enzyme activity, affecting how well digestive enzymes—such as salivary amylase, pepsin, and pancreatic proteases—perform. Each enzyme has an optimal pH range; when local pH departs from that range, digestion and absorption can decline.

## pH across the digestive tract

- Mouth (~6.5–7.5): Slightly acidic to neutral saliva enables salivary amylase to begin starch digestion and helps maintain oral microbial balance.
- Stomach (~1.5–3.5): High acidity from hydrochloric acid activates pepsin for protein digestion, disrupts connective tissue, and provides a barrier to many pathogens.
- Small intestine (~6–7.5 in the duodenum onward): Pancreatic bicarbonate neutralizes gastric chyme so pancreatic enzymes and bile salts can act; this neutral range is crucial for macronutrient breakdown and efficient nutrient uptake.
- Large intestine (~5.5–7): A slightly acidic to neutral environment favors beneficial bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids, which support colonocyte health and systemic effects.

## How pH affects digestion and health

Enzyme activation: Pepsin requires low pH; trypsin and many pancreatic enzymes require near-neutral conditions. If stomach acid is too low, protein digestion and subsequent nutrient signaling can be impaired.

Nutrient absorption: Mineral uptake (iron, calcium, magnesium) is pH-sensitive. For example, iron absorption is favored in mildly acidic environments; alkalinization can reduce bioavailability and contribute to deficiency over time.

Microbial ecology: Local pH shapes which microbes dominate. Acidic regions support Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, while atypical alkalinity in the small intestine can contribute to bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

Defense against pathogens: The stomach’s acidity is a frontline defense that reduces the load of ingested microbes and toxins.

## Common disruptions and practical supports

Conditions associated with pH imbalance include hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid), GERD and reflux (acid exposure of the esophagus), SIBO (often associated with alkaline shifts in the small intestine), and colonic dysbiosis. Management strategies supported by evidence include dietary adjustments (adequate protein, fiber, and fermented foods), addressing stress and sleep which influence secretion and motility, and targeted clinical interventions (e.g., enzyme support, measured stomach acid supplementation) under healthcare supervision.
