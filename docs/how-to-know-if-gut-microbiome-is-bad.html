<p>Assessing gut microbiome health increasingly informs clinical and personal wellness decisions. A balanced gut is diverse, stable, and functionally active; when that balance shifts—known as dysbiosis—multiple systems can be affected. This article summarizes common signs of imbalance, practical markers to watch, and how testing can clarify what’s happening.</p>

<h3>Common signs and patterns</h3>
<p>Gastrointestinal symptoms are the most direct indicators: persistent bloating, excessive gas, chronic constipation, diarrhea, or alternating bowel habits suggest disrupted microbial fermentation or motility. Food intolerances that appear suddenly—such as new sensitivity to lactose or gluten—can also reflect changes in enzyme activity or intestinal barrier function driven by the microbiome.</p>

<p>Beyond digestion, systemic signs may include unexplained fatigue, brain fog, mood changes (anxiety or low mood), skin conditions (acne, eczema), and frequent infections. These manifestations arise because gut microbes influence immune signaling, neurotransmitter production, and metabolic pathways. When multiple symptoms cluster, a microbial component is more likely.</p>

<h3>Objective markers and tests</h3>
<p>Stool-based microbiome profiling measures microbial composition, relative abundance, and diversity. Reduced alpha diversity (fewer distinct species) is commonly associated with less resilient gut ecosystems. Functional assays can quantify short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), inflammatory markers, and the presence of potential pathogens.</p>

<p>Biomarkers such as fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin indicate intestinal inflammation; elevated results merit follow-up with a clinician. Breath tests can help identify small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), while serum markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) offer context about systemic inflammation. Combining symptom tracking with targeted testing gives a clearer picture than either approach alone.</p>

<h3>Interpreting results and next steps</h3>
<p>Microbiome reports typically present diversity metrics, lists of dominant taxa, and any flagged risk organisms. Interpreting these requires attention to clinical context: the same bacterial species can be benign or problematic depending on abundance and host factors. Evidence-based responses include increasing dietary fiber and phytonutrient diversity, reducing highly processed foods, and addressing medications or environmental contributors that may affect microbial balance.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Signs of an unhealthy microbiome span digestive, immune, metabolic, and neurobehavioral domains. Symptom patterns, specific biomarkers, and stool-based testing together form the most informative approach.
