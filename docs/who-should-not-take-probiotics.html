<p>Probiotics are widely promoted for digestive wellness, but they are not universally appropriate. Clinical evidence and case reports indicate that certain people may experience harm or little benefit from over-the-counter probiotic supplements. Understanding contraindications and using diagnostics to guide decisions can reduce risk and improve outcomes.</p>

<h2>When probiotics can be harmful</h2>

<p>Individuals with compromised immunity—such as organ transplant recipients, people on chemotherapy or long-term corticosteroids, and those with severe chronic illnesses—face higher risks. In these populations, live microbial strains have on occasion caused bloodstream infections or other invasive events. Similarly, patients in intensive care, those with central venous catheters, and postoperative abdominal surgery patients may have weakened gut barriers that allow translocation of microbes.</p>

<p>Persons with Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) or marked dysbiosis may worsen symptoms like bloating, gas, and abdominal pain when given broad-spectrum probiotics. In some cases, probiotic strains such as Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium are already overrepresented in an individual's microbiome; adding more may perpetuate imbalance rather than correct it.</p>

<h2>Medication and treatment interactions</h2>

<p>Probiotics can interact with concurrent therapies. Antibiotics may kill probiotic organisms and alter their effectiveness, while immunosuppressants can increase the risk of opportunistic colonization. Other medications—antifungals, antacids, hormonal drugs—can be influenced indirectly through microbial metabolism. Planning around medications and testing the microbiome can clarify whether supplementation is advisable.</p>

<h2>Symptoms and conditions that warrant caution</h2>

<p>People reporting severe intestinal permeability ("leaky gut"), chronic inflammatory conditions, or recent systemic infections should consult a clinician before starting probiotics. Some individuals develop inflammatory or histamine-related reactions, worsening autoimmune symptoms, or mood changes when introduced to certain strains. Infants with necrotizing enterocolitis and some critically ill adult populations have shown adverse outcomes in clinical trials when given probiotics without careful selection.</p>

<h2>How testing can inform safer choices</h2>

<p>Microbiome analysis provides individualized information about species abundance, diversity, and markers associated with inflammation or resistance genes. A targeted gut assessment—such as a <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">gut microbiome test</a>—can reveal whether probiotics are likely to help or harm. For infection-specific evaluation, non-invasive diagnostics like an <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/h-pylori-stool-test-non-invasive-diagnosis-for-stomach-infections">H. pylori stool test</a> may also be relevant to clinical decisions.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Not everyone should take probiotics—people with impaired immunity, disrupted gut barriers, certain infections, or specific medication regimens may be harmed or see no benefit. Individualized assessment, including targeted testing and clinician consultation, helps determine whether probiotic supplementation is appropriate for a given person.
