<p>Increased intestinal permeability, commonly called “leaky gut,” describes a compromised epithelial barrier that permits lumenal contents to interact with the immune system. Objective evaluation blends direct permeability assays, inflammation markers, and microbiome/metabolite data to identify contributors and guide management.</p>

<h3>Key diagnostic tools</h3>
<p>Lactulose-mannitol (L:M) urine testing remains a validated noninvasive method to assess small intestinal paracellular permeability: patients ingest two non-metabolized sugars and urinary excretion ratios are used to infer tight junction integrity. Stool fecal calprotectin quantifies neutrophilic intestinal inflammation and helps distinguish inflammatory disease from functional disorders. Breath testing (hydrogen and methane) evaluates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), a recognized driver of barrier dysfunction in some cases.</p>

<p>Microbiome sequencing (16S rRNA or shotgun metagenomics) and targeted metabolomics add mechanistic context. 16S provides genus-level composition and diversity metrics; shotgun metagenomics enables species-level identification and functional gene profiling (e.g., butyrate synthesis, mucin degradation, LPS biosynthesis). Stool or serum metabolite panels that quantify short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites can directly reflect microbial activity linked to epithelial health.</p>

<h3>Interpreting combined results</h3>
<p>Integration is essential. An elevated L:M ratio alongside low stool butyrate and reduced abundance of butyrate-producing taxa (such as Faecalibacterium and Roseburia) supports a microbiome-mediated permeability hypothesis. Conversely, a high L:M ratio with markedly elevated fecal calprotectin suggests mucosal inflammation that warrants gastroenterology referral and possible endoscopic evaluation. Zonulin and LPS-binding protein are additional serum markers sometimes used; interpret zonulin cautiously because assay variability limits comparability across platforms.</p>

<h3>Practical testing pathway</h3>
<p>A pragmatic evaluation often includes: basic labs (CBC, metabolic panel, CRP), stool pathogen and calprotectin testing, a permeability assay (L:M or comparable), breath testing for SIBO when indicated, and a high-quality stool microbiome test paired with metabolite measurement when available. High-resolution microbiome data can clarify whether dysbiosis—loss of SCFA producers, overgrowth of Gram-negative pathobionts, or increased mucin degraders—is likely contributing to barrier compromise.</p>

Regardless of testing modality, results are most useful when interpreted in clinical context and used alongside symptom tracking and objective inflammatory markers.</p>
