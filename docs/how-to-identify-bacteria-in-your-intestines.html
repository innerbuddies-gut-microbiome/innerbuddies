This article summarizes common signs that your gut bacterial community may be imbalanced, explains how modern testing detects infections and overgrowth, and suggests where to find reliable information for further reading.</p>

<h2>Common indicators of microbial imbalance</h2>
<p>Symptoms linked to an altered gut microbiome range from localized digestive complaints to systemic effects. Digestive signals frequently associated with imbalance include chronic bloating, excessive gas, recurrent diarrhea or constipation, and abdominal pain. These symptoms can reflect altered fermentation of food by bacteria or impaired nutrient absorption.</p>
<p>Non‑digestive indicators may point to a broader dysbiosis: unexplained fatigue, mood changes (anxiety, low mood, brain fog), skin conditions such as acne or eczema, and increased susceptibility to minor infections. These manifestations are consistent with the gut’s roles in immune regulation and neuromodulator production.</p>

<h2>Distinguishing infection, overgrowth, and dysbiosis</h2>
<p>Not all bacterial deviations are infections. Acute intestinal infections—often caused by organisms such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter, or Clostridioides difficile—typically present with severe diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramping. By contrast, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) involves an excessive population of bacteria in the small intestine and produces bloating shortly after meals, belching, and nutrient malabsorption.</p>
<p>Dysbiosis denotes a chronic imbalance in the relative abundance and diversity of species and may underlie persistent, nonspecific symptoms. Distinguishing among these conditions is important because management strategies differ: infections may require targeted antimicrobial therapy, SIBO often uses a combination of dietary adjustments and specific treatments, while dysbiosis may respond to dietary fiber, prebiotics, and tailored probiotics.</p>

<h2>What testing can reveal</h2>
<p>Stool‑based microbiome testing uses DNA sequencing (e.g., 16S rRNA or metagenomics) and, in some platforms, PCR to profile microbial species and relative abundance. These tests can indicate reduced diversity, dominance of opportunistic taxa, and presence of known pathogens. Breath tests measuring hydrogen and methane can support a SIBO diagnosis by detecting gas produced by excessive small intestinal fermentation.</p>

<h2>When testing is useful</h2>
<p>Testing is most informative when symptoms are persistent, follow antibiotic use, or when distinguishing between infection, SIBO, and chronic dysbiosis is clinically important. A stool or breath test can provide objective data to guide dietary, supplemental, or medical approaches, and repeated testing can track recovery or recurrence.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Signs that bacteria in the intestines are contributing to symptoms include persistent digestive disturbances, systemic complaints like fatigue or mood changes, and acute features consistent with infection. Laboratory tools—stool sequencing and breath testing—enable differentiation among infection, overgrowth, and dysbiosis.
