Symptoms typically begin 1–9 days after exposure and escalate quickly, often resulting in severe neurological compromise within days. Understanding early signs and how systemic factors such as gut microbiome health may influence susceptibility can aid timely recognition and clinical evaluation.</p>

<h2>Early clinical features</h2>
<p>Initial symptoms of infection are nonspecific and resemble common viral illnesses: severe frontal headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and neck stiffness. Photophobia (light sensitivity) and phonophobia (sound sensitivity) may also occur. What distinguishes PAM is the speed of deterioration; patients can develop confusion, seizures, and coma within 48–72 hours of symptom onset.</p>

<h2>Progression to neurological dysfunction</h2>
<p>As the amoeba migrates along the olfactory nerve into the CNS, inflammation intensifies and neurological signs predominate. Advanced indicators include altered mental status, seizures, hallucinations, loss of balance, irregular pupillary responses, and rapid decline in consciousness. Cerebral edema is common on neuroimaging and contributes to raised intracranial pressure and respiratory compromise.</p>

<h2>Inflammatory cues and systemic context</h2>
<p>Symptoms of PAM reflect an intense inflammatory response in the meninges and brain parenchyma. The host immune response, including cytokine release and leukocyte infiltration, contributes to tissue damage. Emerging research highlights the gut-brain axis as a modulator of systemic inflammation and immune readiness: microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids influence cytokine balance and blood-brain barrier integrity.</p>

<h2>Gut microbiome relevance</h2>
<p>Although microbiome testing does not diagnose PAM, patterns of dysbiosis—reduced diversity or loss of key taxa involved in anti-inflammatory metabolite production—may be associated with altered immune responses. A balanced gut flora supports mucosal immunity and systemic surveillance, potentially affecting nasal and mucosal defenses where Naegleria entry occurs.

<h2>Clinical implications</h2>
<p>Because early symptoms are nonspecific, clinicians rely on exposure history (warm freshwater activities), rapid progression, and diagnostic testing including cerebrospinal fluid analysis and PCR for Naegleria. Awareness of early warning signs—sudden severe headache, high fever, neck stiffness, and rapid neurological decline—supports faster investigation. A broader assessment of factors that influence immune function, including gut microbiome status, may provide context for individual vulnerability.</p>
