<p>Everyone carries bacteria in their intestines — the question is whether the community is supporting health or contributing to symptoms. This concise guide explains what intestinal bacteria do, common signs of imbalance or infection, and how tests can help clarify whether bacteria are playing a harmful role.</p>

<h2>What intestinal bacteria do and why they matter</h2>
<p>The gut microbiome is a dense ecological community of bacteria, archaea, viruses and fungi. Beneficial bacteria ferment dietary fiber to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that support the gut barrier, modulate immunity, and influence metabolism. Conversely, pathogens or opportunistic overgrowth can cause acute infections or chronic dysfunction. Changes in composition (dysbiosis) are driven by diet, antibiotics, medications, stress, illness and age, and may be linked to symptoms ranging from bloating and altered bowel habits to systemic effects like fatigue.</p>

<h2>Symptoms that suggest bacterial overgrowth or infection</h2>
<p>Patterns help differentiate likely causes. Chronic bloating, excessive gas, and symptom onset soon after meals often point to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever or bloody stools more commonly indicate an acute infectious process from a pathogen such as Salmonella or certain strains of Escherichia coli. Methane-dominant fermentation (detected on breath testing) is frequently associated with constipation. Red flags—high fever, severe abdominal pain, dehydration or bloody stools—require urgent medical evaluation.</p>

<h2>Common tests and what they reveal</h2>
<p>Stool testing: culture, PCR and sequencing can detect pathogens, quantify relative abundances, and report diversity metrics. Molecular methods are sensitive for specific organisms, while sequencing gives a broader snapshot of community structure but requires cautious interpretation.</p>

<p>Breath testing: glucose or lactulose hydrogen and methane breath tests assess fermentation in the small intestine. Early rises in hydrogen suggest SIBO; elevated methane implicates methanogens and may correlate with constipation. Breath tests are noninvasive but can give false positives or negatives depending on transit time and microbial activity.</p>

<p>Small bowel aspirate and culture is the historical gold standard for SIBO diagnosis but is invasive and subject to contamination. Fecal markers (e.g., calprotectin) help distinguish inflammatory conditions from functional disorders.</p>

<h2>How to interpret results</h2>
<p>Lab reports are one piece of the diagnostic puzzle. A positive PCR for a pathogen in someone with compatible symptoms usually indicates infection and guides treatment. Sequencing results showing reduced diversity or loss of SCFA-producing taxa can suggest dysbiosis but do not alone establish causality. Clinical context—symptom pattern, recent antibiotics or travel, and underlying medical issues—is essential for meaningful interpretation.</p>

<h2>Practical next steps</h2>
<p>If symptoms are persistent or severe, discuss testing and interpretation with a healthcare professional. Retesting 2–3 months after treatment or substantial dietary changes can document recovery. Consumer stool kits can provide baseline information; for example, some people use a <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">microbiome test</a> to learn about composition and diversity, then review results with a clinician.</p>
