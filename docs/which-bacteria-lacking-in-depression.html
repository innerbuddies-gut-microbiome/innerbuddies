Rather than a single pathogen causing mood disorders, studies point to reduced abundance and diversity of beneficial taxa that contribute to neurotransmitter production, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis, and barrier integrity. For a primer on how microbiome types are classified, see <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/what-are-the-three-types-of-microbiome">the three types of microbiome</a>.</p>

<h2>Key bacteria often reduced in depression</h2>
<p>Multiple clinical and metagenomic studies repeatedly identify a set of bacteria that tend to be underrepresented in people with major depressive disorder (MDD) or subclinical depressive symptoms:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lactobacillus spp.</strong> — These genera contribute to GABA and other neuroactive compounds; lower levels have been correlated with anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes in animal models.</li>
  <li><strong>Bifidobacterium spp.</strong> — Important for intestinal barrier function and immune modulation; strains such as <em>B. longum</em> have shown anxiolytic and mood-stabilizing effects in trials.</li>
  <li><strong>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</strong> — A major butyrate producer with anti-inflammatory properties; decreased abundance is common in depressed cohorts.</li>
  <li><strong>Coprococcus spp.</strong> — Associated with well-being scores and SCFA production; depletion correlates with poorer mental-health metrics.</li>
  <li><strong>Roseburia spp.</strong> — Another butyrate-producing group linked to both metabolic and neurochemical homeostasis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mechanisms connecting missing microbes to mood</h2>
<p>Deficits in these microbes can reduce SCFA output (particularly butyrate), impair mucosal barrier integrity, and promote low-grade systemic inflammation. Endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) may translocate across a more permeable gut lining, triggering cytokine responses that influence the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and neurotransmitter systems. Reduced microbial contributions to precursors for serotonin, dopamine and GABA further limit the gut’s role in supporting brain chemistry.</p>

<h2>Microbiome profiles and clinical relevance</h2>
<p>Depressive gut profiles commonly show lower alpha diversity and an overrepresentation of pro-inflammatory taxa. These patterns are not diagnostic on their own but can act as biological signals to guide personalized interventions. For readers interested in strain-level considerations, there is growing literature on psychobiotic strains and on species such as <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/bifidobacterium-infantis-a-natural-solution-for-ibs-relief-and-gut-inflammation">Bifidobacterium infantis</a>, and a concise summary is available in a short note on <a href="https://telegra.ph/Bifidobacterium-infantis-A-Natural-Solution-for-IBS-Relief-and-Gut-Inflammation-12-16">Bifidobacterium infantis</a> research.</p>

<h2>Testing and prudent next steps</h2>
<p>Microbiome testing can map which taxa are depleted and which pathways (e.g., SCFA synthesis, mucin production) may be impaired. Lab-based panels and at-home kits provide relative abundance data that clinicians can integrate with clinical history. For informational purposes, one resource that describes testing options is <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">microbiome testing</a>. Any interpretation should be contextualized with diet, medication history, and psychosocial factors; treatment decisions are best made collaboratively with healthcare providers.</p>

<p>In summary, depression-associated microbiota often show reduced Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus and Roseburia. These deficits affect metabolite production, immune signaling, and barrier function—mechanisms plausibly linked to mood regulation.
