Research supports several drinks that ease bloating, reduce inflammation, and support microbial diversity. This article summarizes evidence-based options and practical considerations for using beverages to soothe the gut.</p>

<p><strong>Bone broth:</strong> A traditional remedy, bone broth supplies collagen, gelatin, glutamine and minerals that support mucosal repair and gut barrier function. Collagen and gelatin can help coat and protect the intestinal lining, while glutamine is an amino acid commonly studied for its role in enterocyte recovery. Drinking 8–12 ounces before a meal or incorporating broth into soups may aid digestion and tissue repair. Choose low-salt preparations and consult a clinician if you have renal or cardiovascular conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Peppermint tea:</strong> Peppermint contains menthol, an antispasmodic that relaxes smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract, which can relieve gas, cramping, and bloating. Randomized trials using peppermint oil have demonstrated symptom improvements in irritable bowel syndrome. Steep dried peppermint leaves for 8–10 minutes and avoid routine use if you have significant gastroesophageal reflux, as peppermint can relax the lower esophageal sphincter.</p>

<p><strong>Kefir and fermented beverages:</strong> Fermented milk drinks such as kefir are rich in live bacteria and yeast strains that promote microbial diversity and short-chain fatty acid production. Regular consumption (small daily servings, e.g., 4–6 ounces) can improve lactose digestion in some people and support colonocyte health through butyrate production. Non-dairy versions (water or coconut kefir) are available for those with milk sensitivity.</p>

<p><strong>Chamomile and calming infusions:</strong> Chamomile contains flavonoids (e.g., apigenin) and compounds with anti-inflammatory and mild anxiolytic effects. Because the gut and brain are linked, reducing nervous-system-driven motility disturbances with chamomile can help stress-related digestive symptoms. Steep for 10 minutes and combine with fennel or lemon balm if tolerated for additional antispasmodic benefit.</p>

<p><strong>Ginger and aloe vera:</strong> Ginger is well-supported for nausea and motility enhancement; a simple infusion or grated ginger in hot water can reduce postprandial discomfort. Aloe vera juice has been used to soothe mucosal inflammation, but choose preparations without anthraquinone laxatives and limit use if you have colorectal surgery or chronic laxative dependence.</p>

<p>Personalization matters. Microbiome composition affects how an individual responds to probiotic or prebiotic beverages; targeted insight from tools like a <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">gut microbiome test</a> can help align drink choices with microbial needs. For research on specific microbes and metabolic effects, see work on the <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/unlocking-roseburia-intestinalis-gut-microbe-weight-loss">role of Roseburia intestinalis</a> in host metabolism. Broader platform developments that link gut health to aging are discussed in the <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/innerbuddies-new-longevity-healthy-aging-module">Longevity & Healthy Aging module</a>, with a recent announcement available at <a href="https://telegra.ph/InnerBuddies-Adds-Longevity--Healthy-Aging-Module-to-Gut-Health-Platform-01-25">the Telegraph summary</a>.</p>
