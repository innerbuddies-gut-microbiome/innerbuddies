Bacteroidetes are a major bacterial phylum in the human gut that specialise in breaking down complex carbohydrates and fiber. Supporting a healthy level of Bacteroidetes can improve fiber fermentation, produce beneficial metabolites, and help maintain gut barrier function. For an accessible overview, see [How to Increase Bacteroidetes in Your Gut for Better Health | InnerBuddies](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/how-to-increase-bacteroidetes-in-your-gut-for-better-health-innerbuddies).

## What Bacteroidetes Do and Why They Matter

Bacteroidetes degrade polysaccharides from plants, legumes, and whole grains, turning these substrates into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate and propionate. SCFAs nourish colonocytes, support mucosal integrity, and modulate local immune responses. Balanced Bacteroidetes abundance is associated with improved digestion and may influence systemic metabolic markers, although individual responses vary.

## Dietary Approaches to Support Bacteroidetes

- Increase dietary fiber: Foods rich in soluble and insoluble fiber—oats, barley, legumes, apples, broccoli, and whole grains—provide substrates that favour Bacteroidetes activity.
- Include diverse plant foods: A variety of vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds promotes microbial diversity and resilience.
- Add fermented foods: Yogurt, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut can enhance microbial diversity and support communities that coexist with Bacteroidetes.

Example meals might include oatmeal with fruit and yogurt for breakfast, a bean-and-greens salad for lunch, and whole-grain rice with steamed vegetables and legumes for dinner.

## Probiotics and Bacteroidetes

Most commercial probiotic strains belong to Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium groups, not Bacteroidetes. Rather than expecting direct supplementation with Bacteroidetes, evidence-based strategies focus on creating an environment that supports their growth: increased fiber intake, reduced excessive simple sugars, and maintaining microbial diversity. When choosing products or protocols, prioritise clinically studied strains and consult a healthcare professional for guidance.

## Lifestyle Factors

- Stress management: Chronic stress can alter gut motility and secretions, shifting microbial balance. Mindfulness, moderate exercise, and adequate sleep help support a stable microbiome.
- Regular physical activity: Observational studies link physical activity to greater gut microbial diversity, which can indirectly support Bacteroidetes populations.
- Avoid unnecessary antibiotics: Antibiotics can reduce microbial diversity; use them only when clinically indicated and follow medical advice.

## Tracking and Personalisation

Microbiome testing can reveal relative abundances of major bacterial groups, including Bacteroidetes, and help tailor dietary and lifestyle recommendations. InnerBuddies provides resources to interpret individual profiles and apply targeted changes; related content explores diet–microbiome interactions such as low-carbohydrate approaches and personalised nutrition. See an analysis of dietary patterns and gut response in <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/gut-feeling-exploring-the-keto-diet">Exploring the keto diet and gut</a> and consider how personalised guidance can refine choices: <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/innerbuddies-personalized-gut-microbiome-nutrition">InnerBuddies personalised gut microbiome nutrition</a>.

## Practical summary

To favour Bacteroidetes: prioritise a diverse, fiber-rich diet, include fermented foods, manage stress, stay active, and avoid unnecessary antibiotics. Individual microbiome profiles vary, so monitoring and personalised adjustments can improve outcomes. The evidence supports modest, sustained changes rather than rapid dietary overhauls.</body></html>
