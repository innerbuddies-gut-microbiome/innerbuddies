<p>The SIBO test is a non-invasive breath test that detects excess bacteria in the small intestine by measuring gases produced when microbes ferment specific sugars. This article summarizes what breath testing measures, why it works, the differences between lactulose and glucose substrates, and practical steps for preparation, sample collection and interpretation.</p>

<h2>Principles of Breath Testing</h2>

<p>Bacteria and some archaea in the gut produce gases—mainly hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), and occasionally hydrogen sulfide (H2S)—when they ferment carbohydrates. After ingestion of a defined substrate, these gases diffuse into the bloodstream and are exhaled. Serial breath samples create a time-versus-gas profile: an early rise typically indicates small-intestinal fermentation consistent with SIBO, whereas a later rise reflects normal colonic fermentation. Breath testing therefore measures metabolic activity rather than directly counting organisms.</p>

<h2>Lactulose vs Glucose</h2>

<p>Lactulose is not absorbed and travels through the small bowel to the colon, producing a biphasic curve that can detect distal small-intestinal overgrowth but may give false positives with rapid transit. Glucose is rapidly absorbed in the proximal small intestine, offering higher specificity but lower sensitivity for distal SIBO. Clinicians choose the substrate based on clinical suspicion and the trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity.</p>

<h2>Preparing for the Test</h2>

<p>Accurate results depend on preparation. Typical guidance includes a low-residue or low-FODMAP diet for 24–48 hours, fasting for 8–12 hours before testing (water usually allowed), and avoiding smoking, gum, or vigorous exercise prior to sampling. Many protocols advise stopping antibiotics and probiotic supplements for at least two to four weeks when clinically safe, and reviewing other medications such as proton pump inhibitors or prokinetics with the ordering clinician. Proper mouth rinsing before baseline samples prevents oral microbial contamination.</p>

<h2>Breath Sample Collection</h2>

<p>Samples are taken at baseline and then every 15–20 minutes for a specified period (commonly 90–150 minutes) after ingesting the substrate. Collection can be direct into a real-time analyzer or into sealed tubes or bags for laboratory analysis. Key factors for valid samples include full exhalation into the device, correct timing, secure sealing of collection containers, and avoidance of ambient contamination.</p>

<h2>Interpreting Results and Next Steps</h2>

<p>Laboratories report hydrogen and methane in parts per million (ppm). Common thresholds include a rise in hydrogen of ≥20 ppm within 90 minutes or a methane level ≥10 ppm at any time, though criteria vary. Positive tests guide targeted therapy—choices differ for hydrogen- versus methane-dominant patterns—and may be combined with dietary strategies and motility support. Negative tests do not always rule out SIBO; false negatives can occur with recent antibiotics or when overgrowth is distal and missed by glucose testing.</p>
