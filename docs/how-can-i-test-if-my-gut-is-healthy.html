Symptoms such as bloating, irregular bowel movements, food sensitivities, chronic fatigue, and skin changes can indicate imbalance, but objective tests provide a clearer picture of digestion, inflammation, barrier integrity, and microbial composition.</p>

<h2>Key categories of gut testing</h2>
<p>Modern evaluations typically fall into four complementary areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Digestive function tests</strong> — Hydrogen and methane breath tests for SIBO, pancreatic enzyme measurements, and gastric pH assessments help determine whether your gut is breaking down and absorbing food properly.</li>
  <li><strong>Microbiome analysis</strong> — DNA sequencing of stool identifies species composition, diversity, and functional potential. This reveals whether beneficial taxa are depleted or opportunistic organisms are overrepresented.</li>
  <li><strong>Inflammation markers</strong> — Stool calprotectin, lactoferrin, and secretory IgA quantify immune activation in the gut and help distinguish inflammatory conditions from functional disorders.</li>
  <li><strong>Intestinal permeability tests</strong> — The lactulose–mannitol absorption test and zonulin measurements assess whether the intestinal barrier is allowing larger molecules to cross into the circulation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Choosing the right test based on symptoms</h2>
<p>If bloating and gas are prominent, a breath test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is often informative. Persistent loose stools with weight loss or blood warrant inflammatory markers and imaging guided by a clinician. When multiple food sensitivities or systemic symptoms (skin, joints, fatigue) exist, permeability testing alongside microbiome sequencing can help identify contributing mechanisms.</p>

<h2>What microbiome reports can tell you</h2>
<p>Sequencing-based reports show diversity (a marker of ecosystem resilience), presence or absence of key beneficial genera, and overgrowths that may produce toxins or impair metabolism. Coupled with inflammation data, these results can highlight whether microbial shifts are associated with immune activation or barrier disruption.

<h2>Interpreting results and next steps</h2>
<p>Test results are most useful when interpreted alongside clinical history by a qualified practitioner. Typical interventions guided by testing include dietary adjustments (fiber variety, reduced triggers), timed use of specific probiotic strains, and targeted support for digestion or barrier repair (e.g., enzyme support, glutamine, zinc carnosine) when indicated.

<h2>Practical testing options</h2>
<p>Many labs provide home stool collection kits for sequencing, PCR pathogen panels, and inflammation markers. Breath testing is frequently arranged through clinics. If you opt for a sequencing-based stool panel, a microbiome test can add functional and species-level detail that complements inflammation and permeability assays (<a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">microbiome test</a>).</p>

<p>In short, combine symptom tracking with targeted testing for digestion, inflammation, microbes, and permeability to create an evidence-based plan.
