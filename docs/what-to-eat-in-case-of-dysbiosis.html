<p>Dysbiosis—an imbalance in the gut microbial community—can contribute to digestive symptoms, systemic inflammation, and altered immune responses. Diet is one of the most accessible levers for rebalancing the microbiome. The following evidence-informed guidance summarizes key food categories and practical strategies to support microbial recovery while minimizing factors that favor pathogenic overgrowth.</p>

<h2>Foundational Principles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reduce fermentable simple sugars and refined carbohydrates that can fuel opportunistic microbes.</li>
  <li>Emphasize both probiotics (live microbes) and prebiotics (substrates that feed beneficial species).</li>
  <li>Include nutrients that support mucosal repair—e.g., glutamine, zinc, collagen—and anti-inflammatory components.</li>
  <li>Personalize intake based on symptoms and, where available, microbiome testing to target deficits and excesses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Foods to Include</h2>
<p>Focus on whole, minimally processed foods that supply diverse fibers, polyphenols, and microbiota-accessible substrates:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fermented foods:</strong> Unsweetened yogurt with live cultures, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso and tempeh introduce live strains and can increase microbial diversity when tolerated.</li>
  <li><strong>Prebiotic-rich vegetables:</strong> Garlic, leeks, onions, asparagus, and Jerusalem artichoke contain inulin and oligosaccharides that preferentially feed bifidobacteria and other beneficial taxa.</li>
  <li><strong>Collagen and bone broths:</strong> Provide amino acids (glycine, proline) that support tissue repair and may help restore barrier integrity.</li>
  <li><strong>Omega-3–rich seafood and polyphenol-dense plants:</strong> Fatty fish, berries, leafy greens and turmeric help reduce gut inflammation and modulate immune signaling.</li>
  <li><strong>High-fiber whole foods:</strong> A mix of soluble and insoluble fibers from legumes, whole grains (if tolerated), nuts and seeds promotes short-chain fatty acid production, notably butyrate, which nourishes colonocytes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Foods to Limit or Avoid</h2>
<p>Minimize refined sugars, artificial sweeteners, excessive alcohol and highly processed foods. Individuals with known intolerances (e.g., lactose, gluten) should avoid triggers while working with a clinician to reintroduce items cautiously.</p>

<h2>Personalization and Testing</h2>
<p>Microbiome profiling can clarify which taxa are depleted or overrepresented and guide dietary choices and probiotic strain selection.

<p>When available, validated gut profiling such as the <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">InnerBuddies Microbiome Test</a> can support iterative adjustments. Start dietary changes gradually, monitor symptoms, and consider periodic reassessment every 3–6 months to evaluate microbial and clinical response.</p>

<p>In sum, a dysbiosis-focused diet emphasizes diverse fibers and plant compounds, fermented and collagen-supporting foods, anti-inflammatory fats and spices, and the avoidance of highly processed and sugar-rich items. Personalization and periodic testing improve the precision and effectiveness of these dietary interventions.</p></article></body></html>
