Accurate stool sample collection is essential for reliable microbiome testing. Errors in collection, handling, or storage can alter microbial composition and DNA integrity, reducing the usefulness of test results. This article summarizes practical, evidence-informed best practices and compares common approaches used by Viome, Zoe, and InnerBuddies users.

## Core principles of stool sample best practices

A high-quality stool sample should represent your typical gut microbiota and be free from external contamination. Key practices include:

- Use only the collection tools provided; avoid touching the sample with bare hands.
- Prevent contact with toilet water or other surfaces that may introduce environmental microbes.
- Collect and seal the sample promptly to reduce oxygen exposure and microbial shifts.
- Keep collection equipment and surfaces clean; gloves and disposable liners help reduce contamination.

These measures reduce the chance of altered bacterial proportions or degraded nucleic acids during transit to the laboratory.

## Preparing for microbiome testing

Pre-collection preparation improves representativeness. Maintain your usual diet for several days prior to collection and avoid substantial dietary changes. When possible, refrain from antibiotics, probiotics, or intensive exercise immediately before sampling, as these can transiently affect gut communities. Collecting the sample shortly after a typical bowel movement (often in the morning) helps capture a consistent snapshot of your gut environment.

## Viome: sealing with a stool cap

Viome’s kit commonly includes a specialized stool cap designed to lock the specimen away from ambient air and contaminants. Proper use involves securing the cap tightly and avoiding contact with the inner surfaces of the cap or tube. Rapid sealing minimizes oxygen exposure and helps preserve anaerobic taxa that are sensitive to oxygen, which supports more accurate downstream sequencing.

## Zoe: emphasis on temperature control

Zoe’s guidance often stresses temperature stabilization. When immediate shipping is not possible, refrigeration can slow microbial activity and reduce compositional drift. Using insulated packaging or cold packs during transport (if supplied) further limits temperature excursions that could alter relative abundances of temperature-sensitive organisms.

## InnerBuddies: kit design and user-focused instructions

InnerBuddies provides compact kits and clear user instructions to simplify collection while minimizing contamination. Practical recommendations from users include preparing a clean collection surface, wearing gloves, and sealing the sample without delay.

## Choosing a method that fits your routine

Each approach balances ease, speed, and preservation: Viome’s stool cap is effective at rapid sealing; Zoe emphasizes refrigeration and controlled temperature; InnerBuddies focuses on simplicity and clear instructions for routine users. Consider your typical day, access to refrigeration, and shipping timelines when deciding which kit or protocol aligns with your circumstances.

## After collection: storage and shipping

Store samples as instructed by the testing provider and track shipments to ensure timely receipt by the lab. Once processed, sequencing and analysis yield taxonomic and functional profiles used for interpretation and recommendations. Follow provider-specific instructions to maintain sample integrity during transit.
