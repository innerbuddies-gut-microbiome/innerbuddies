<p>The health of the gut influences digestion, immunity, mood and long-term wellness. Assessing gut health combines clinical symptom evaluation with laboratory and sequencing-based tests to answer specific questions: Is there infection, inflammation, malabsorption, or an imbalance in the microbial community? This short guide explains practical testing options, how samples are collected, and how results are interpreted with professional support.</p>

<h2>Start with symptom and digestive health assessments</h2>
<p>Begin with a structured symptom history or questionnaire that documents bowel habits, stool form, timing of symptoms, recent antibiotics, and systemic signs such as fatigue or weight loss. These assessments help clinicians select targeted tests (for example, stool inflammation markers if blood is present, or breath testing for suspected small intestinal bacterial overgrowth).</p>

<h2>Laboratory and functional tests</h2>
<p>Common clinical tests include blood panels for nutrient deficiencies (iron, B12, vitamin D), fecal calprotectin to screen for intestinal inflammation, and fecal elastase to assess pancreatic exocrine function. Breath tests using lactulose or glucose measure hydrogen and methane to detect SIBO or carbohydrate malabsorption. Fecal fat quantification and specific antibody or genetic tests (e.g., celiac serology) are used when malabsorption or specific diseases are suspected.</p>

<h2>Stool sample testing and molecular panels</h2>
<p>Stool testing ranges from culture and microscopy to PCR pathogen panels and comprehensive stool analyses that include digestive markers and inflammatory proteins. Many at-home kits stabilize DNA or other analytes for reliable transit to the lab; follow kit instructions closely to avoid contamination. For a practical overview of sequencing-based testing and how to collect samples, see this guide on how to get gut health tested: <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/how-to-get-gut-health-tested">How do you get tested for your gut health?</a></p>

<h2>Microbiome sequencing and profiling</h2>
<p>Consumer and clinical services use 16S rRNA or whole-metagenome sequencing to identify taxa and infer functional potential. Sequencing reveals diversity, relative abundance of key commensals (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium) and overgrowth of opportunists. While sequencing shows composition, it does not directly measure metabolic activity—so combine genomic results with symptoms, SCFA measures, or metabolomics when possible.</p>

<h2>Interpreting results and next steps</h2>
<p>Review findings with a clinician or dietitian experienced in gut disorders. Actionable results include treating infections, addressing SIBO, correcting deficiencies, or implementing dietary strategies to increase fiber diversity and support beneficial fermenters. Sequencing reports can guide probiotic or prebiotic choices, but selection should be evidence-based and symptom-driven. Consider repeat testing after 3–6 months to track changes when interventions are implemented.</p>

<p>Consumer sequencing kits and clinical tests are complementary; some people use a kit as a baseline or monitoring tool while pursuing clinical evaluation for diagnostic certainty.
