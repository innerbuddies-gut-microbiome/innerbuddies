Gut microbiota, often called gut flora, is the community of microorganisms — bacteria, viruses, archaea and fungi — that inhabit the human digestive tract. Estimates suggest tens to hundreds of trillions of microbes live in and on the body, with most concentrated in the gut; an individual typically carries several hundred bacterial species. These organisms act like a metabolic organ, influencing digestion, nutrient production, immune development and signalling to other organs.

Key functions

Gut microbes produce vitamins and metabolites, prevent pathogen overgrowth, and train the immune system. One important group of metabolites are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, propionate and butyrate; SCFAs feed colon cells, strengthen the gut barrier, reduce inflammation and influence lipid and glucose metabolism in the liver. Microbial genes collectively outnumber human genes and expand the metabolic capacity available to the host.

What shapes the microbiota

A person’s microbiota develops from birth and changes over a lifetime. Factors that significantly shape gut composition include mode of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean), breastfeeding, early antibiotic exposure, diet diversity, physical activity, household pets and the surrounding environment (urban versus rural). Diet is particularly influential: fibres and resistant starches escape digestion in the upper gut and are fermented by microbes in the colon, supporting beneficial species.

Testing and interpretation

Microbiome analysis — using stool-based profiling, 16S rRNA sequencing or shotgun metagenomics — can characterise microbial diversity and identify imbalances associated with symptoms or health risks. Testing may inform approaches to digestive complaints, personalized dietary adjustments, immune-related concerns, mood and metabolic health. Results commonly report alpha diversity, relative abundance of key genera, and potential functional capabilities. Interpretation is context-dependent: diversity is generally favourable, but the optimal composition varies with age, diet and clinical history. Test results are most useful when considered alongside symptoms and medical advice.

Practical, evidence-based ways to support gut health

Modifiable behaviours that tend to support a diverse, resilient microbiota include eating a varied diet rich in plant fibres, incorporating fermented foods, avoiding unnecessary antibiotics, maintaining regular physical activity, managing sleep and stress, and increasing exposure to diverse environments (for example, contact with green spaces or pets can broaden microbial exposure). These measures aim to provide substrates for beneficial microbes and limit conditions that favour opportunistic pathogens.
