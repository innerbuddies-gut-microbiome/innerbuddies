This partnership integrates academic research, diagnostic development and platform engineering to produce a standardized, evidence-based metric for assessing gut microbiome status. For background on the collaboration, see the InnerBuddies announcement: [InnerBuddies works with Astrolab and Universidad EAFIT on the next generation of their Gut Microbiome Health Index (GMHI)](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/news/innerbuddies-works-with-astrolab-and-universidad-eafit-in-colombia-on-the-next-generation-of-their-gut-microbiome-health-index-gmhi).

Universidad EAFIT brings established research capacity in metagenomics and metabolomics. Its research group (CIBIOP/TechLIie) developed Biomatest, a diagnostic workflow that combines sequencing-based taxonomic profiling with untargeted metabolomic signatures to characterize gut microbial communities and their functional impact. Publications from EAFIT researchers, including studies of pregnant and lactating women in Antioquia, Colombia, have identified metabolite markers that correlate with microbiome function and maternal–child nutritional status. These findings illustrate how combined omics (microbial composition plus metabolome) can inform biomarkers relevant to health outcomes.

Astrolab Biotecnología, founded by Dr. Laura Sierra-Zapata, is positioned to translate these research outputs into diagnostic and advisory services. The company’s emphasis on both human and animal microbiomes complements EAFIT’s academic research, enabling a translational pathway from discovery to clinically relevant reporting.

InnerBuddies will host the new Biomatest product on its platform, adding personalized nutrition guidance, food-diary integration and individualized probiotics/prebiotics recommendations derived from the integrated omics profile. The platform integration aims to standardize reporting and make the GMHI accessible beyond the original research context. As part of the collaboration, the GMHI will be implemented across InnerBuddies’ B2B user base and will be available to consumers in scheduled rollouts.

Methodologically, the GMHI synthesizes taxonomic diversity metrics and functional metabolite signals into a single score (0–100) to provide a concise summary of gut microbiome health. Scores are designed to reflect community balance and the presence of taxa or metabolites associated with healthier metabolic and immune profiles. The index will be offered in adult and youth (under 18) versions to account for age-related microbiome composition differences.

The cooperative agreement includes joint scientific innovation, clinical trials and peer-reviewed publications to validate and refine the index. Astrolab and EAFIT will lead the research components—study design, sample analysis and interpretation—while InnerBuddies contributes platform analytics and data integration capabilities. Transparency about methods, reproducibility of results and peer review are noted priorities in the collaboration.

The GMHI release is planned for March 2025, at which point consumers will be able to interpret a numerical score alongside explanatory context and potential personalized recommendations.
