These tests analyze stool to profile bacteria and other microbes, but can they reliably detect food intolerances or sensitivities? This article summarizes what microbiome testing measures, how those measures relate to food reactions, and the limits of current evidence.</p>

<h2>How microbiome tests work and what they show</h2>

<p>Most consumer microbiome tests use DNA sequencing to identify microbes in stool. Simpler tests target the 16S rRNA gene to classify bacterial groups; more comprehensive approaches use shotgun metagenomics to infer microbial species and functional genes. Reports commonly include measures of bacterial diversity, relative abundance of taxa, and inferred metabolic potential (for example, enzymes that break down fiber or lactose).</p>

<p>These outputs are inherently probabilistic. A microbiome report can suggest that a person has fewer lactose-digesting microbes or elevated gas-producing species, but it does not provide a clinical diagnosis of lactose intolerance or other food reactions. Instead, the data identify patterns that may help form hypotheses to test with clinical methods and dietary experiments.</p>

<h2>Connections between microbes and specific food reactions</h2>

<p>There are biologically plausible links between microbial composition and several types of food issues. For example, lower levels of Bifidobacteria and other lactose-assimilating bacteria have been associated with worse dairy tolerance in some studies. Microbes that ferment FODMAPs can produce hydrogen and methane gases, contributing to bloating and discomfort. Certain strains can produce or degrade histamine, which may influence reactions to histamine-rich foods.</p>

<p>Microbiome analysis can also point to markers of inflammation or reduced butyrate-producing bacteria such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which have been associated with increased intestinal permeability and low-grade inflammation—mechanisms sometimes invoked in food sensitivities. These associations make microbiome testing a useful investigative tool when conventional diagnostics are inconclusive.</p>

<h2>When to use microbiome testing versus clinical tests</h2>

<p>Clinical tests remain the gold standard for diagnosing conditions that require specific treatment or have safety implications: IgE testing for food allergy, lactose breath tests, and serology/biopsy for celiac disease. Microbiome testing is complementary—most helpful for chronic, unexplained symptoms where standard testing is negative or when you want to explore personalized dietary adjustments.</p>

<p>Used alongside symptom tracking and controlled elimination/reintroduction, microbiome results can guide hypotheses (for instance, whether a low abundance of certain microbes might explain poor tolerance to dairy or FODMAPs). They do not replace clinical evaluation but can add context and direction for further testing or dietary trials.</p>
