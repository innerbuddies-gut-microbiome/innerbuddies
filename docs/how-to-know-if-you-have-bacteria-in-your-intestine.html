This article explains how to distinguish a healthy gut microbiome from dysbiosis or bacterial infection, which diagnostic options exist, and which clinical markers are useful for evaluation.</p>

<h2>Common signs of imbalance versus infection</h2>
<p>A balanced gut contains trillions of bacteria that support digestion, immunity, and metabolic functions. Signs that the microbiome may be imbalanced (dysbiosis) include persistent bloating, gas, irregular bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea), unexplained fatigue, skin changes, and mood disturbances. By contrast, an acute intestinal infection typically produces more severe, sudden symptoms such as high fever, profuse watery or bloody diarrhea, marked abdominal pain, nausea, and dehydration.</p>

<h2>Which tests detect intestinal bacteria?</h2>
<p>Stool-based tests using DNA sequencing are now widely used to profile bacterial populations, estimate diversity, and flag potential pathogens. Methods such as 16S rRNA sequencing and shotgun metagenomics identify which taxa are present and in what relative abundance. For suspected small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), hydrogen/methane breath testing is the standard noninvasive tool; it measures gases produced by bacteria fermenting a sugar substrate in the small intestine. In clinical settings, jejunal aspirate and culture remain a more direct—but invasive—diagnostic option for SIBO.</p>

<p>Many providers also measure functional and inflammatory biomarkers. Stool calprotectin indicates intestinal inflammation, zonulin is associated with intestinal permeability, and secretory IgA reflects mucosal immune activity. Elevated beta-glucuronidase can suggest microbial activities that affect detoxification and hormones. Combining microbiota profiling with biomarker data provides a broader view of gut health.</p>

<h2>Interpreting results and next steps</h2>
<p>Finding bacteria in the intestine is expected; the clinical question is whether the composition, diversity, or activity of those bacteria correlates with symptoms. A microbiome report that shows low diversity, overrepresentation of opportunistic taxa, or reduced levels of keystone species (for example, <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/unlocking-faecalibacterium-prausnitzii-gut-immune">Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</a>) can suggest dysbiosis. Breath tests indicating early hydrogen or methane rises support a SIBO diagnosis. Elevated inflammatory markers like calprotectin warrant further evaluation for inflammatory bowel disease or infectious causes.</p>

<h2>When to consult a healthcare professional</h2>
<p>Seek medical attention for high fever, severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, signs of dehydration, or blood in the stool. For chronic or unexplained symptoms, working with a clinician to interpret microbiome and biomarker results ensures that findings are placed into the appropriate clinical context. One available diagnostic resource is a comprehensive <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/how-to-know-if-you-have-bacteria-in-your-intestine">guide to recognizing and testing for intestinal bacteria</a>, and specialized lab services (for example, a microbiome test) can provide detailed microbial profiling.</p>

<p>In summary, the presence of bacteria in the intestine is normal; determining whether those bacteria are contributing to symptoms relies on symptom assessment, targeted testing (stool DNA sequencing, breath tests), and interpretation of inflammatory and functional biomarkers. Combining these data with clinical evaluation helps distinguish harmless microbial variation from dysbiosis or infection.</p></article></body></html>
