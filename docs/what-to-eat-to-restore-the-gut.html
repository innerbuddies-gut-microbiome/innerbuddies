Restoring the gut after dysbiosis or digestive stress involves targeted nutrition, probiotic support, and lifestyle changes informed by testing. A focused eating plan can repair the intestinal barrier, increase microbial diversity, and reduce inflammation.</p>

<h2>Use Testing to Personalize Your Approach</h2>
<p>Microbiome analysis provides a snapshot of which bacteria are abundant, depleted, or producing inflammatory metabolites. Interpreting those results helps prioritize interventions—whether to emphasize prebiotics for low bifidobacteria, polyphenols for low diversity, or anti-inflammatory foods for elevated markers. For a practical overview on dietary strategies, see <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/what-to-eat-to-restore-the-gut">what to eat to restore the gut</a>. For related context on testing options, resources such as <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/how-to-get-gut-health-tested">how to get gut health tested</a> and a concise guide on testing workflows at <a href="https://telegra.ph/How-do-you-get-tested-for-your-gut-health-01-10">How do you get tested for your gut health</a> can be helpful starting points.</p>

<h2>Key Foods and Nutrients for Repair</h2>
<p>Focus on nutrient-dense, minimally processed foods that support mucosal repair and beneficial microbes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Prebiotic fibers:</strong> Onions, garlic, leeks, asparagus, bananas and chicory feed SCFA-producing bacteria.</li>
  <li><strong>Fermented foods:</strong> Yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso and tempeh introduce live cultures and enzymes.</li>
  <li><strong>Collagen and glutamine sources:</strong> Bone broth and glutamine-rich greens support epithelial regeneration.</li>
  <li><strong>Omega-3 fats and monounsaturated oils:</strong> Fatty fish, flax, walnuts and extra-virgin olive oil reduce gut inflammation.</li>
  <li><strong>Polyphenol-rich foods:</strong> Berries, green tea, cocoa and olives promote growth of beneficial taxa.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical Phases for Restoration</h2>
<p>Phase 1—reduce acute irritants: limit refined sugars, ultra-processed foods, excess alcohol and non-essential NSAIDs while the lining repairs. Phase 2—rebuild the barrier: prioritize collagen, cooked vegetables, gentle starches and small amounts of fermented foods. Phase 3—repopulate and diversify: expand high-fiber plants, fermented foods, and pursue variety to encourage microbial richness. If antibiotic exposure or severe dysbiosis occurred, a targeted <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">microbiome test</a> and clinical guidance may inform whether a probiotic supplement is appropriate.</p>

<h2>Lifestyle Supports</h2>
<p>Sleep, stress management, regular physical activity and mindful eating directly influence microbial ecology and intestinal permeability. Practices that stabilize circadian rhythms and reduce chronic stress enhance repair processes and support long-term microbial resilience. Interactions with household animals also shape the microbiome; see research on <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/pets-impact-gut-microbiome">pets' impact on the gut microbiome</a> for ecological considerations.</p>

<p>Restoration is gradual: many people notice symptomatic improvement within weeks, while microbial diversity shifts may take 8–12 weeks or longer. Use testing data and symptom tracking to adjust dietary phases and re-evaluate progress over time.</p></article></body></html>
