<p>Managing intestinal inflammation requires a combination of evidence-based dietary choices and attention to digestive function. Dietary strategies can reduce mucosal irritation, support repair of the gut lining, and encourage a microbial profile that produces anti-inflammatory metabolites such as butyrate. Microbiome testing can help tailor these recommendations to an individual’s unique microbial composition.</p>

<h2>Foundations for dietary intervention</h2>
<p>Begin by stabilizing digestion: eat slowly, stay hydrated, and avoid overeating. Reduce exposure to highly processed foods, emulsifiers, and excess refined sugar, as these can alter microbial balance and disrupt the mucus layer. If testing reveals enzyme or bile insufficiency, focusing on smaller, more frequent meals and enzyme-supporting foods (bitter greens, ginger) can ease digestive load.</p>

<h2>Core foods that calm the gut</h2>
<p>Foods that support barrier integrity and microbial diversity are central to anti-inflammatory plans. Bone broth provides collagen and amino acids like glutamine that support enterocyte repair. Fermented vegetables (kimchi, sauerkraut) and cultured dairy alternatives introduce live microbes that may restore diversity when introduced gradually. Resistant starches—cooled rice, lentils, and underripe bananas—feed butyrate-producing bacteria and mitigate inflammation in the colon.</p>

<h2>Targeted nutrients and botanicals</h2>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA, DHA) modulate inflammatory signaling and are found in oily fish, flax, and algae-based sources. Soluble fibers and prebiotics—such as inulin, garlic, onions, leeks, and asparagus—encourage growth of beneficial commensals. Polyphenol-rich foods (berries, green tea, dark leafy greens) act as antioxidants and selective substrates for protective microbes. Botanicals like turmeric and ginger have demonstrated local anti-inflammatory effects and can be incorporated into meals.</p>

<h2>Personalization using microbiome insight</h2>
<p>Microbiome analysis can indicate whether specific anti-inflammatory strategies are likely to be effective. For example, low abundance of butyrate producers suggests prioritizing resistant starches and prebiotics, whereas an overrepresentation of histamine-producing bacteria may warrant temporary reduction of fermented foods.
