<p>Intestinal healing often requires a combination of precise diagnostics, targeted nutrients, and dietary adjustments. This evidence-based overview explains what to take to heal the intestines, focusing on microbiome assessment, probiotic and prebiotic strategies, supportive supplements, and anti-inflammatory foods to restore barrier function and microbial balance.</p>

<h2>Role of Microbiome Assessment</h2>
<p>Understanding the composition of the gut microbiome is foundational to choosing appropriate interventions. At-home or clinical stool analysis can reveal low diversity, overgrowth of opportunistic organisms, or deficiencies in beneficial taxa. For a practical guide on interpreting results and next steps, consult the <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/unlocking-gut-health-secrets-microbiome-tests-guide">microbiome tests guide</a>. In some cases, testing also informs links between gut status and mental well-being; see research summaries such as the <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/gut-microbiome-test-mental-health">microbiome test and mental health</a> overview and a related discussion on mood and cognition (<a href="https://telegra.ph/Can-My-Gut-Microbiome-Test-Results-Help-Improve-My-Mental-Health-and-Mood-12-23">gut microbiome and mood</a>).</p>

<h2>Probiotics and Prebiotics</h2>
<p>Probiotics (live microorganisms) and prebiotics (nondigestible fibers that feed beneficial microbes) are central to restoring microbial balance. Multi-strain probiotics containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species have been associated with reductions in IBS symptoms and improved barrier integrity in clinical studies. Prebiotic fibers such as inulin, FOS, and GOS selectively promote short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production—especially butyrate—which supports colonocyte health and tight junction maintenance. Combining both as synbiotics can be more effective than either alone; selection should be informed by microbial profiling when possible.</p>

<h2>Targeted Supplements for Intestinal Repair</h2>
<p>Certain nutrients directly support mucosal recovery. L-glutamine is an amino acid that serves as a primary fuel for enterocytes and has shown benefit in reducing intestinal permeability. Zinc (including zinc-carnosine formulations) supports mucosal repair and immune modulation. Digestive enzymes can reduce luminal stress from poorly digested macronutrients, and mucilaginous botanicals like slippery elm or marshmallow root provide a soothing protective layer while inflammation resolves. Dosages and combinations vary by diagnosis and should be individualized.</p>

<h2>Anti-inflammatory Nutrition and Lifestyle</h2>
<p>Diet influences both the microbial ecosystem and the mucosal environment. Emphasize fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, fermented foods, omega-3 sources, and collagen-containing broths while limiting refined sugars, processed oils, and food additives that can perpetuate dysbiosis. Gradual dietary changes tend to be better tolerated in sensitive individuals. Supporting sleep, stress management, and regular physical activity also contributes to microbial diversity and immune regulation.</p>

<h2>Integrating Testing with Interventions</h2>
<p>Combining diagnostic data with evidence-based interventions creates the most reliable path to sustained improvement. For individuals seeking a convenient testing option, an <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">at-home microbiome test</a> can provide actionable insights to tailor probiotic, prebiotic, supplement, and dietary choices. Periodic re-assessment helps verify progress and refine the protocol.</p>

<p>Overall, healing the intestine is a stepwise process that pairs targeted supplements and foods with diagnostic guidance and lifestyle measures to rebuild barrier function and microbial balance.</p>
