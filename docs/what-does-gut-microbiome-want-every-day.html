  <h1>What does a gut microbiome want you to eat every day?</h1>
  <p>The gut microbiome influences digestion, immunity, metabolism, and even aspects of mood. Daily food choices shape which microbial species thrive and which decline. Evidence-based recommendations emphasize variety, fiber diversity, and foods that support beneficial metabolic outputs like short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).</p>

  <h2>Daily fundamentals</h2>
  <p>Across populations and studies, a few consistent patterns emerge: diverse plant foods, regular sources of prebiotic fiber, fermented items with live microbes, and polyphenol-rich ingredients favor microbial diversity and metabolic health. Practically, this means aiming for many different fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds across the week rather than repeating the same limited menu.</p>

  <h2>Key food groups</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Varied fibers:</strong> Different bacteria ferment different fibers. Include soluble fibers (oats, legumes, apples) and insoluble fibers (whole grains, vegetables) to support a broad community.</li>
    <li><strong>Prebiotic foods:</strong> Garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, bananas, and chicory contain fibers like inulin and fructooligosaccharides that selectively feed beneficial taxa.</li>
    <li><strong>Fermented foods:</strong> Yogurt, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut can introduce live microbes and support ecological stability when consumed regularly.</li>
    <li><strong>Polyphenol-rich items:</strong> Berries, green tea, coffee, cocoa, and olives provide compounds that microbes metabolize into bioactive molecules associated with reduced inflammation.</li>
    <li><strong>Healthy fats:</strong> Omega-3 sources (fatty fish, flaxseed, walnuts) show links to anti-inflammatory microbial profiles.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What to limit</h2>
  <p>Highly processed foods, excessive added sugars, artificial sweeteners, and certain emulsifiers have been associated with reduced diversity or unfavorable shifts in some studies. Moderate alcohol intake and prudent use of antibiotics are also relevant because they can transiently or persistently alter composition.</p>

  <h2>Personalization through testing</h2>
  <p>Because each person’s microbiome is unique, testing can help prioritize which interventions are most relevant. For example, a report showing low butyrate-producing bacteria would justify emphasizing resistant starches and specific fibers, while a profile dominated by gas-producing species might prompt adjustments to fermentable carbohydrates.

  <h2>Practical summary</h2>
  <p>Each day, prioritize a variety of plant-based fibers, include at least some prebiotic and fermented foods, and favor whole over processed items. Use testing data when available to fine-tune which fibers or fermented foods are most appropriate for your profile. A simple, evidence-informed pattern of diverse, minimally processed foods typically supports a resilient microbiome and measurable functional benefits over time.</p>
