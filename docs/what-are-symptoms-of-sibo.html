<p>Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) occurs when bacteria that normally live in the colon overpopulate the small intestine, disrupting digestion and nutrient absorption. Common manifestations include persistent bloating, excessive gas, abdominal pain, and irregular bowel movements. This article summarizes the clinical signs of SIBO, explains why they occur, and shows how symptom patterns relate to microbiome testing and follow-up resources.</p>

<h2>Key digestive symptoms</h2>

<p>Typical digestive complaints are bloating shortly after meals, excessive flatulence, abdominal cramping, and either diarrhea or constipation. Timing is important: fermentation in the small intestine tends to cause symptoms within 30–60 minutes after eating, whereas colonic fermentation often produces later symptoms. Methane-dominant overgrowth is frequently associated with constipation, while hydrogen-dominant overgrowth more often causes diarrhea.</p>

<p>Gas composition and stool changes can offer diagnostic clues. Hydrogen rises suggest carbohydrate fermentation by bacteria, whereas elevated methane implicates methanogenic archaea that slow transit. Some patients report alternating bowel habits, urgency, incomplete evacuation, or visible abdominal distension, which collectively point toward motility disturbance combined with microbial imbalance.</p>

<h2>Systemic and nutrient-related signs</h2>

<p>When bacterial overgrowth persists, malabsorption can lead to weight loss, deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), B12 deficiency, and iron-deficiency anemia. Patients may report fatigue, hair thinning, brittle nails, or neurological symptoms such as brain fog and paresthesia. Chronic SIBO can also aggravate food sensitivities and low-grade inflammation, contributing to non-specific systemic complaints.</p>

<h2>How testing links symptoms to cause</h2>

<p>Breath tests using lactulose or glucose measure hydrogen and methane produced by microbial fermentation; an early rise in these gases indicates fermentation in the small bowel and supports a SIBO diagnosis. Stool-based microbiome analyses can complement breath testing by documenting alterations in bacterial diversity, abundance of opportunistic species, and metabolic potential — for example, reduced butyrate production or elevated D-lactate producers that correlate with cognitive symptoms.

<h2>When to investigate further</h2>

<p>Red flags that should prompt more comprehensive workup include unexplained weight loss, persistent nutrient deficiencies, severe or progressive neurological symptoms, and signs of systemic inflammation. Repeat or complementary testing is often useful to monitor response to treatment and to differentiate SIBO from overlapping conditions like IBS, IBD, or food intolerances.</p>

<h2>Practical resources and common pitfalls</h2>

<p>Interpreting tests and managing SIBO can be complex.

<p>Recognizing symptom patterns and linking them to validated tests helps clinicians and patients pursue a focused diagnostic path, minimize misdiagnosis, and design appropriate management strategies that address both microbial imbalance and functional consequences.</p></article></body></html>
