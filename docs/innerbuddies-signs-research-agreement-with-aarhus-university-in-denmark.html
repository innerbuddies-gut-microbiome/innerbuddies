This announcement summarizes a new data-sharing agreement with Aarhus University and outlines the scope and safeguards of the collaboration.

InnerBuddies recently signed a research agreement with Aarhus University to support investigations led by Dr. Sonja Perkovic, an associate professor with a background in behavioral science and growing interest in the gut–brain axis. The collaboration will enable exploratory analyses of how gut microbiome composition relates to aspects of human behavior such as stress, sleep, and decision-making.

Most InnerBuddies customers explicitly opt in to allow their anonymized data to be used for scientific research. Under the agreement, InnerBuddies will supply Dr. Perkovic with an anonymized dataset drawn only from customers who have consented to such use. The dataset will include gut microbiome composition measures (taxonomic composition and predicted bacterial functions) together with selected self-reported survey variables: biological sex, age group, and responses to validated questions about stress and sleep. These variables are intended to permit analyses that investigate associations between microbiome features and behavioral or cognitive-related measures while limiting the amount of personal information shared.

Data governance and legal compliance are central to the arrangement. The shared dataset will be strictly anonymized and provided for a specified research purpose. The agreement stipulates that the data will be used only for the defined study, that results may be published in aggregated, non-identifiable form, and that the dataset will be deleted after the study concludes. All data handling will comply with EU GDPR requirements and institutional review procedures at Aarhus University.

Dr. Perkovic’s research program spans decision-making and health-related behavior, including dietary choices and exposure reduction to environmental chemicals. Her emerging work on the gut–brain axis seeks to clarify potential pathways by which microbiome composition might influence cognitive processes and preferences. This cooperation aims to combine microbiome profiling with behavioral measures to explore whether variations in gut communities are associated with changes in stress responses, sleep patterns, or decision biases.

The collaboration also explores potential follow-up projects that examine causality and mechanisms: for example, whether microbiome differences correlate with decision-making tendencies and whether such correlations could reflect directional influences or confounding factors. Translational research of this kind typically requires careful replication, control for lifestyle and demographic variables, and transparent reporting of methods and limitations to avoid overinterpretation of associative findings.

This partnership exemplifies how anonymized, consented participant data can enable interdisciplinary research at the intersection of microbiology and behavioral science while adhering to ethical and legal standards. Further results will be reported in peer-reviewed outlets when analyses are complete.
