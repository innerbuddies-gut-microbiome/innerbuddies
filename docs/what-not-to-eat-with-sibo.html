Diet plays a central role in managing symptoms: certain foods provide fuel for bacterial fermentation in the small bowel and are often best limited during active symptoms.</p>

<h2>Foods commonly to avoid</h2>

<p>High-fermentable carbohydrates are among the most important triggers. The Low FODMAP framework identifies many of these, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fructans and GOS: wheat, onions, garlic, and legumes</li>
  <li>Lactose: milk, soft cheeses, and some yogurts</li>
  <li>High-fructose fruits: apples, pears, and products with high-fructose corn syrup</li>
  <li>Polyols: sugar alcohols such as sorbitol or xylitol found in sugar-free gums and candies</li>
</ul>

<p>Other dietary factors that can worsen SIBO symptoms include refined sugars and processed carbohydrates, which are rapidly fermented; alcohol, which increases gut permeability; and artificial sweeteners that may alter microbial composition. Very large, fatty meals and frequent snacking can impair the migrating motor complex (MMC), the intestinal cleansing wave that helps prevent bacterial stasis in the small bowel.</p>

<h2>Dietary approach and testing</h2>

<p>A temporary low-FODMAP or low-fermentable carbohydrate approach can reduce symptomatic fermentation, but prolonged, unrestricted restriction risks reducing beneficial microbes. Reintroduction and personalization are therefore essential. Microbiome testing can inform which species are overrepresented and which beneficial taxa are depleted, helping tailor reintroduction strategies. For example, an analyzed stool sample via a <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">microbiome test</a> may show specific fermentative overgrowths or deficits that influence food choices.</p>

<p>Resources that explain diet and inflammation or how testing translates into actionable advice can be helpful when planning a long-term strategy: see guidance on how to <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/how-to-reduce-inflammation-and-detox-intestine">reduce intestinal inflammation and support barrier function</a>, and a technical overview of <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/from-raw-data-to-action-how-innerbuddies-translates-gut-microbiome-analysis-into-personalized-advice">how gut microbiome analysis is translated into personalized recommendations</a>. A practical summary of turning raw data into dietary steps is also available in an article titled <a href="https://telegra.ph/From-Raw-Data-to-Action-How-InnerBuddies-Translates-Gut-Microbiome-Analysis-Into-Personalized-Advice-12-21">From Raw Data to Action</a>.</p>

<h2>Habits and other considerations</h2>

<p>Beyond specific foods, eating patterns matter: avoid constant grazing, consider spacing meals to support MMC activity, and limit late-night large meals. During active SIBO, introduce fibers and prebiotics cautiously—some can feed pathogenic species early in recovery—while prioritizing non-fermentable, soluble fibers such as psyllium for stool consistency. Addressing gut motility, stress, sleep, and moderate physical activity are complementary measures that reduce recurrence risk.</p>

<p>For practical planning, consult evidence-based resources and a healthcare provider who can integrate clinical assessment, breath testing or stool microbiome results, and symptom response.
