Microbial imbalances can arise after antibiotics, illness, chronic stress, or a low-fiber diet, producing symptoms such as bloating, irregular bowel habits, or fatigue. A deliberate, evidence-based approach—grounded in testing, targeted supplementation, dietary change, and lifestyle adjustments—offers the best chance of sustainable recovery. This article summarizes practical, science-informed options for what to take and how to support a resilient gut ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Use testing to guide interventions</h2>
<p>Microbiome testing provides a snapshot of microbial composition and functional markers, which helps prioritize interventions instead of relying on guesswork. For assessment and ongoing tracking, a dedicated <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">gut microbiome test</a> can reveal deficits in key species, inflammation signals, and short-chain fatty acid production. Testing is not perfect—a stool sample reflects a moment in time—but when combined with symptoms and dietary history it enables targeted choices for probiotics, prebiotics, and healing supports.</p>

<h2>Probiotics: targeted reintroduction of beneficial strains</h2>
<p>Probiotic supplements introduce live organisms that can help rebalance the gut. Well-studied groups include Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, which support digestion and immune function, and the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii for antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Selection should be strain-specific and informed by testing or clinical patterns. Typical dosing ranges from billions to tens of billions of CFUs daily, but individual needs vary. Note that in cases like SIBO or immune compromise, probiotic introduction requires professional oversight.</p>

<h2>Prebiotic foods and fibers: feed beneficial microbes</h2>
<p>Prebiotics are nondigestible fibers that selectively feed helpful bacteria and promote short-chain fatty acid production, notably butyrate. Foods high in inulin, resistant starch, and oligosaccharides include garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, chicory root, and green bananas. Aim for dietary variety—rotating plant sources and colors encourages multiple microbial niches. Those with IBS or FODMAP sensitivity should advance prebiotic intake gradually and use test results or practitioner guidance to avoid symptom flares.</p>

<h2>Gut-healing nutrients and lifestyle supports</h2>
<p>Reinforcing the intestinal barrier and reducing inflammation accelerates microbiota restoration. Supplements with evidence for mucosal support include L‑glutamine, collagen peptides or bone broth, zinc carnosine, and omega‑3 fatty acids. Digestive enzymes and HCl can improve macronutrient breakdown when malabsorption is present. Behavioral factors—consistent sleep, stress management, moderate physical activity, and reduced ultraprocessed food—also shape microbial composition positively.</p>

<h2>Diversity and long-term resilience</h2>
<p>Microbial diversity correlates with metabolic and immune health. Strategies to enhance diversity include consuming 25+ different plant foods per week, incorporating fermented foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut) in moderation, and rotating probiotic strains or multispecies formulations. Environmental exposure—gardening, outdoor activity, and safe pet contact—may contribute to microbial variety.
