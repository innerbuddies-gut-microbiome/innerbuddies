A structured, evidence-based approach combines nutrient-dense foods that support the intestinal lining with substrates that feed beneficial microbes. Integrating data from a gut microbiome assessment can make dietary choices more precise, tailoring recommendations to individual microbial profiles.</p>

<h2>Why testing matters</h2>
<p>Gut microbiome testing reveals the composition and diversity of bacteria present in the large intestine. Results commonly highlight issues such as low diversity, dysbiosis, or reduced short-chain fatty acid production—factors that impair barrier function and inflammation control. Using these insights helps prioritize which foods to introduce or limit. For a practical overview, see recommendations on <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/what-to-eat-to-heal-the-gut">what to eat to heal the gut</a>.</p>

<h2>Key food groups for gut repair</h2>
<p>Several categories of foods consistently support gut healing and microbial balance:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fermented foods:</strong> Unsweetened yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi supply live microbes that can increase intestinal microbial diversity. In some conditions (e.g., histamine intolerance or SIBO), fermented foods may need careful introduction.</li>
  <li><strong>Resistant starches:</strong> Cooked-and-cooled potatoes, green bananas, legumes, and certain whole grains resist digestion and ferment in the colon, producing butyrate—a key fuel for colonocytes and a regulator of inflammation.</li>
  <li><strong>Collagen and gelatin sources:</strong> Bone broth and collagen-containing foods provide amino acids such as glutamine and glycine, which support mucosal repair and tight junction integrity.</li>
  <li><strong>Fiber-rich plants:</strong> A variety of vegetables, fruits, and allium vegetables (onions, leeks, asparagus) deliver prebiotic fibers like inulin and pectin that selectively nourish beneficial taxa.</li>
  <li><strong>Anti-inflammatory fats and polyphenols:</strong> Fatty fish, walnuts, olive oil, berries, and green tea supply omega-3s and antioxidants that reduce mucosal inflammation and modulate microbial communities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical considerations</h2>
<p>Start gradually: introduce fibers and fermented foods slowly to monitor tolerance, especially if dysbiosis or sensitivity exists. Cooking methods such as steaming, gentle roasting, or slow-simmering broths improve digestibility. For individuals recovering from antibiotics or chronic dysbiosis, a phased 5R strategy (remove, replace, reintroduce, reinoculate, restore) aligns dietary steps with clinical goals.</p>

<h2>Personalized restoration and related resources</h2>
<p>Microbiome-informed plans can recommend specific prebiotics, probiotic strains, and foods to target deficiencies—an approach that avoids universal prescriptions. For example, low levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a key butyrate producer, may indicate benefit from increased resistant starch and polyphenol intake; learn more about this organism in a focused review <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/faecalibacterium-prausnitzii-the-microbe-that-could-change-your-diet">on Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</a> and a companion article hosted on Telegraph <a href="https://telegra.ph/Faecalibacterium-prausnitzii-The-Microbe-That-Could-Change-Your-Diet-12-11">covering its dietary implications</a>.</p>

<p>If abdominal discomfort radiates to the back or presents atypically, consider reading clinical descriptions of referred pain patterns to better characterize symptoms: <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/what-does-back-pain-from-intestines-feel-like">what back pain from intestinal sources can feel like</a>.</p>

<p>For clinicians and informed individuals, integrating standardized microbiome test results with dietary adjustments and lifestyle factors such as sleep, stress management, and physical activity yields the most consistent improvements in intestinal wellness.</p>
