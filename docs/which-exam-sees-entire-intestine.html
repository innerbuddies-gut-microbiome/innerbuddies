Clinicians commonly combine endoscopic and imaging modalities to evaluate structure, function, and microbiome-related changes across the whole gastrointestinal tract.</p>

<h2>Overview of whole-intestine visualization</h2>
<p>No single test provides all types of information; rather, a combination of procedures can give a near-complete view. For lumenal mucosal inspection of the small bowel, capsule endoscopy is uniquely capable of traversing and imaging the entire small intestine, while cross-sectional imaging such as CT enterography and MR enterography maps bowel wall, mesentery, and complications beyond the mucosal surface. Together these methods form a comprehensive approach to seeing the entire intestine (<a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/which-exam-sees-entire-intestine">which exam sees the entire intestine</a>).</p>

<h2>Capsule endoscopy and deep enteroscopy</h2>
<p>Capsule endoscopy involves swallowing a camera capsule that transmits thousands of images throughout its transit. It excels at detecting mucosal lesions, small ulcers, bleeding sources, and areas of inflammation in the small bowel that conventional endoscopy cannot reach. It is diagnostic rather than therapeutic—areas of concern identified by capsule studies may require follow-up with deep enteroscopy, which allows biopsy and intervention.</p>

<h2>CT and MR enterography</h2>
<p>CT enterography combines contrast-enhanced CT imaging with oral contrast to distend the small bowel and visualize mural disease, strictures, fistulae, and extraintestinal complications. MR enterography provides similar anatomic and functional detail without ionizing radiation, making it preferred for longitudinal assessment in younger patients or chronic conditions. These modalities image the entire small and large intestine in cross-section and are especially useful when structural disease is suspected.</p>

<h2>When microbiome testing indicates further evaluation</h2>
<p>Molecular microbiome analysis from stool or targeted sampling can reveal dysbiosis, altered bacterial profiles, or markers suggestive of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Abnormal microbiome patterns sometimes prompt structural evaluation; for example, persistent dysbiosis alongside malabsorption or obscure bleeding may lead clinicians to order capsule endoscopy or enterography. Resources on broader testing strategies, including home-based assessments, can be found in practical guides such as <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/how-to-test-gut-health">how to test gut health</a> and concise overviews like <a href="https://telegra.ph/How-can-I-test-my-gut-health-02-03">How can I test my gut health?</a>.</p>

<h2>Integrating findings for clinical decisions</h2>
<p>Optimal evaluation often combines imaging, endoscopy, and microbiome data. Cross-referencing capsule images with MR or CT enterography can localize lesions and define their depth and extraintestinal impact. When household or familial patterns of microbiome similarity are relevant to diagnosis or epidemiology, see resources on <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/family-household-gut-microbiome-similarity">family household gut microbiome similarity</a>. Clinicians use this integrated evidence to guide biopsy, medical therapy, dietary modification, or referral for specialized care.</p>

<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
<p>Capsule endoscopy provides full mucosal visualization of the small intestine; CT and MR enterography supply whole-tract cross-sectional imaging. Together, these techniques—when interpreted alongside microbiome testing such as an <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">InnerBuddies microbiome test</a>—offer a comprehensive assessment of intestinal health. Decisions about which exams to use should be individualized and made in consultation with a gastroenterologist.</p></article></body></html>
