Accurate testing is important because SIBO symptoms overlap with other conditions like IBS and carbohydrate malabsorption; selecting the appropriate diagnostic method guides therapy and further evaluation.</p>

<h2>Primary diagnostic approaches</h2>
<p>Clinicians use two main categories of tests: direct sampling and indirect functional tests. Jejunal aspirate and culture is a direct method that can quantify colony-forming units (CFU) from proximal small-bowel fluid and identify organisms and susceptibilities. Because it requires endoscopy and samples a limited region, it is reserved for complex or refractory cases.</p>

<p>Non-invasive breath testing is the most commonly used frontline approach. Breath tests measure gases produced by bacterial fermentation after ingestion of a carbohydrate substrate. The lactulose breath test uses a non-absorbable sugar to detect early fermentation in the small bowel, while glucose breath testing uses an absorbable monosaccharide that typically highlights proximal SIBO. Both assays measure hydrogen and methane; methane measurement is necessary to detect methane-dominant overgrowth often associated with constipation. Standard pretest preparation (dietary restrictions, antibiotic/probiotic washout, fasting) and standardized sampling intervals improve reliability, but protocols and interpretation thresholds vary across labs.</p>

<h2>Interpreting results and limitations</h2>
<p>Interpretation depends on timing and magnitude of gas rises. An early rise in hydrogen or methane (commonly within 60–90 minutes) suggests small bowel fermentation consistent with SIBO; a later rise more likely reflects colonic fermentation and may indicate carbohydrate malabsorption. False positives can arise from rapid small-bowel transit (causing early colonic fermentation on lactulose), while false negatives may occur when methanogens convert hydrogen to methane or when organisms produce gases not routinely measured (e.g., hydrogen sulfide). Glucose testing is more specific for proximal disease but can miss distal overgrowth; lactulose can detect distal patterns but is more transit-dependent.</p>

<h2>Distinguishing SIBO from carbohydrate malabsorption</h2>
<p>Carbohydrate malabsorption (e.g., lactose intolerance) is typically diagnosed with substrate-specific breath tests. Timing and symptom correlation are key: an early gas rise suggests SIBO-related fermentation in the small bowel, whereas a later rise with typical symptoms supports primary malabsorption. Clinicians often use a combination of breath tests and clinical history to differentiate causes and may repeat testing after addressing confounders.</p>

<h2>Complementary and emerging tools</h2>
<p>Imaging and motility testing help identify structural or functional contributors (strictures, blind loops, hypomotility). Molecular methods and stool sequencing offer insights into colonic community structure but do not directly diagnose SIBO because stool reflects colonic rather than small intestinal populations.

<p>Stool-based consumer kits can complement clinical testing by characterizing colonic dysbiosis over time; one example is the InnerBuddies microbiome test (<a href='https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test'>InnerBuddies microbiome test</a>). Ultimately, combining clinical evaluation with appropriately selected breath or aspirate testing—and, when indicated, imaging and motility assessment—yields the most accurate diagnostic picture for suspected bacterial overgrowth.</p></article></body></html>
