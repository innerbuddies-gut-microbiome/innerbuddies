  <p>Your gut influences digestion, immunity, nutrient absorption, hormone balance, and even mood. When the gut microbiome—the community of bacteria, fungi, and other microbes—falls out of balance, a range of physical and mental symptoms can appear. This article summarizes common sensations and signs that often accompany an unhealthy gut and explains how testing and simple lifestyle adjustments can clarify the cause.</p>

  <h2>Common sensations and symptoms</h2>
  <p>Unhealthy gut symptoms can be varied, but several patterns recur in clinical and research literature:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Persistent bloating and excessive gas after meals</li>
    <li>Digestive distress such as cramps, indigestion, nausea, diarrhea, or constipation</li>
    <li>Unexplained food sensitivities or delayed reactions to certain foods</li>
    <li>Chronic fatigue, brain fog, or low motivation</li>
    <li>Skin issues and mood changes like anxiety or low mood</li>
    <li>Irregular bowel movements or stools that change in consistency</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What drives these sensations?</h2>
  <p>Many symptoms arise from dysbiosis—an imbalance in microbial diversity or relative abundance. Dysbiosis can reduce production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that support the intestinal barrier and energy metabolism, increase inflammatory signaling, and impair digestion of specific nutrients. When the intestinal lining becomes more permeable (often called "leaky gut"), larger food particles can interact with the immune system and trigger sensitivities or systemic inflammation.</p>

  <h2>Digestive signals: bloating, gas and bowel changes</h2>
  <p>Excess gas and bloating commonly result from bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates. Conditions such as small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) shift the site and timing of fermentation, producing early post-meal bloating. Constipation or diarrhea can reflect altered microbial production of metabolites that regulate motility and fluid balance.

  <h2>Fatigue, mood and the gut-brain axis</h2>
  <p>The gut communicates with the brain via neural, endocrine, and immune pathways. Imbalances can reduce microbial contributions to neurotransmitter precursors and micronutrient availability (for example, B vitamins), which may manifest as persistent tiredness or cognitive sluggishness.</p>

  <h2>Identifying causes and next steps</h2>
  <p>Microbiome analysis can provide a snapshot of diversity, relative abundances, and potential overgrowths that correlate with symptoms. A neutral overview of personalized testing and interpretation is available for reference at <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">microbiome test information</a>.

  <h2>Practical, evidence-aligned supports</h2>
  <p>Evidence-based approaches focus on restoring microbial diversity and barrier function: increasing varied dietary fiber, including fermented foods, addressing nutrient deficiencies, and reducing prolonged stress. Specific interventions are most effective when guided by objective data and a clinician or qualified practitioner.</p>

  <p>Recognizing sensations associated with an unhealthy gut helps prioritize objective evaluation and measured lifestyle changes rather than trial-and-error. Careful assessment can clarify causes and support targeted strategies to reestablish balance.</p>
