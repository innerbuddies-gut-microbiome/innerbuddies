The gut microbiome—the trillions of microbes in your intestines—helps regulate immunity and digestion, and it can be disrupted by both the infection and the foods you consume while ill.</p>

<h2>Foods that commonly worsen symptoms</h2>
<p>Certain items are more likely to aggravate inflammation, prolong diarrhea, or feed opportunistic microbes. Avoiding these can reduce symptom burden:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dairy: Temporary lactase deficiency after a viral illness can make milk, soft cheeses, and some yogurts hard to digest, increasing bloating and diarrhea.</li>
  <li>Fried, greasy, and high-fat foods: These slow gastric emptying and can intensify nausea and abdominal discomfort.</li>
  <li>Raw high-fiber vegetables, legumes, nuts, and whole grains: Insoluble fiber can irritate inflamed intestines and speed transit, worsening loose stools.</li>
  <li>Sugary foods and drinks: High osmolarity and fermentable sugars draw water into the gut and can fuel dysbiotic bacteria, worsening diarrhea.</li>
  <li>Artificial sweeteners (e.g., sorbitol, sucralose): Poorly absorbed sugars that can ferment and provoke gas and loose stools.</li>
  <li>Spicy and acidic foods: Capsaicin and strong acids may irritate the mucosal lining and delay healing.</li>
  <li>Caffeine and alcohol: Both can increase secretion and motility, worsen dehydration, and negatively alter microbial balance.</li>
  <li>Highly processed foods and additives: Preservatives and artificial colors offer little nutritional support and can promote inflammation in sensitive states.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gentle alternatives and reintroduction</h2>
<p>Start with bland, low-fat, low-fiber options—plain rice, toast, applesauce, bananas, broths, and mashed potatoes—while fluids and electrolytes are being restored. As symptoms improve, gradually reintroduce more complex foods one at a time and monitor tolerance. Fermented or probiotic foods can help during recovery, but they are best introduced after acute vomiting or severe diarrhea subsides.</p>

<h2>Why personalized data matters</h2>
<p>Individual variation in microbiome composition means that food tolerance during infection can differ widely. Microbiome-aware resources can clarify which microbes are overrepresented or deficient, and which food types might help or hinder recovery.

<p>For clinicians and informed readers, a microbiome test can clarify personalized tolerances and recovery strategies; general information about testing is available at <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">microbiome test</a>. If symptoms are severe or prolonged, seek medical evaluation.</p></article></body></html>
