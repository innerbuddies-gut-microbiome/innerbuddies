Good digestion and a robust immune system are central to overall health. When digestion is efficient, nutrient absorption improves and immune defenses function more effectively. Natural supplements—derived from plants, herbs, and beneficial microbes—can provide targeted support for both systems with generally mild side effects when used appropriately.

This article summarizes evidence-based options and practical considerations. For a concise overview of recommended options see the [Top 10 Natural Supplements to Improve Digestion and Boost Immunity](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/top-10-natural-supplements-to-improve-digestion-and-boost-immunity).

- Probiotics: Live microorganisms such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains help restore microbial balance, support digestion, and modulate immune activity in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Clinical trials show benefits for antibiotic-associated diarrhea and some functional bowel symptoms.

- Ginger: Multiple studies support ginger’s antiemetic and prokinetic effects, making it useful for nausea and delayed gastric emptying. It also has mild anti-inflammatory properties that can ease digestive irritation.

- Peppermint: Peppermint oil can relax intestinal smooth muscle and reduce symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, including cramping and bloating. Enteric-coated preparations reduce the risk of heartburn.

- Licorice root (DGL): Deglycyrrhizinated licorice supports mucosal health and may help soothe gastric lining inflammation. DGL preparations are recommended to avoid glycyrrhizin-related side effects such as sodium retention.

- Fennel seeds: Traditionally used to reduce bloating and flatulence, fennel has antispasmodic effects on intestinal muscles and may improve postprandial discomfort.

- Echinacea: Often used to support innate immune responses, echinacea extracts have shown mixed results in clinical trials but may reduce severity or duration of upper respiratory infections when taken early.

- Vitamin C–rich herbs (rose hips, acerola): These provide natural sources of vitamin C and polyphenols. Vitamin C supports various immune cell functions and acts as an antioxidant to protect tissues from oxidative stress.

- Elderberry: Standardized elderberry extracts are rich in anthocyanins and may reduce symptom duration and severity for some viral upper respiratory infections, likely via antioxidant and immune-modulating actions.

Combining digestive and immune support

The gut plays a central role in immune regulation: a large proportion of immune cells reside in the gastrointestinal tract, and the microbiome influences systemic immunity. Supporting gut barrier integrity and microbial balance can therefore have downstream benefits for immune resilience.

Safety and practical tips

Select reputable brands with transparent sourcing and third-party testing. Start at recommended doses, monitor responses, and avoid interactions with medications. Pregnant or nursing individuals and people with chronic conditions should consult a healthcare professional before beginning supplements. A personalized assessment—such as information from laboratory testing or a clinical review—can help tailor choices; for example, some choose a microbiome assessment like <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">Microbiome Test</a> to guide interventions.

Conclusion

Natural supplements can support digestion and immunity when chosen carefully and used alongside a balanced diet and lifestyle. Evidence supports several options—probiotics, ginger, peppermint, licorice (DGL), fennel, echinacea, vitamin C–rich herbs, and elderberry—but individual needs and responses vary. Evaluate safety, quality, and relevant biomarkers to make informed decisions.</body></html>
