Raw milk—unpasteurized milk directly from cows, goats, or sheep—has attracted both enthusiastic followers and strong warnings from public health authorities. Proponents cite richer nutrient profiles, natural enzymes, and potential benefits for digestion and allergy resistance. Critics emphasize the increased risk of foodborne illness from pathogens such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Listeria. This article reviews what the scientific literature shows about raw milk benefits and the safety considerations that should guide informed choices.

## What is raw milk and how does it differ from pasteurized milk?

Raw milk retains its native bacteria, enzymes, and full complement of heat-sensitive compounds. Pasteurization heats milk to reduce or eliminate pathogenic organisms and extend shelf life; some heat-sensitive vitamins and enzymes may be reduced in the process. However, pasteurized milk remains a source of high-quality protein, calcium, and many bioactive components important to health.

## Evidence on nutritional differences

Comparative studies generally find few meaningful nutritional differences between raw and pasteurized milk for most consumers. Some nutrients (for example, small amounts of vitamin C) can decrease with heat treatment, but milk is not a primary dietary source of those nutrients. Differences in enzyme activity and minor bioactive molecules have been documented, but their clinical significance for long-term health remains uncertain. Overall, the nutritional advantages often claimed for raw milk are modest and not consistently demonstrated in controlled research.

## Raw milk and gut health

One common argument for raw milk is its potential to support the gut microbiome through naturally occurring bacteria. While raw milk contains microbes that could interact with the gut, evidence that these microbes produce measurable, beneficial changes in the human gut microbiome is limited. Fermented dairy products such as yogurt and kefir provide live cultures with a stronger evidence base for probiotic effects and carry a much lower risk of serious infection. For personalized insights into how diet and probiotics might affect gut composition, resources on microbiome testing and diagnosis can be informative; for example, see <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/gut-microbiome-testing-diagnosis-obesity">microbiome testing and diagnosis</a> and research on <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/the-gut-microbiome-and-its-relationship-to-mindfulness">the relationship between the gut microbiome and mindfulness</a>.

## Safety and foodborne illness risk

The clearest and most consistent finding in public health monitoring is that raw milk carries a higher risk of transmitting pathogenic bacteria. Outbreak investigations repeatedly link raw milk to gastrointestinal disease, hospitalizations, and, in some cases, long-term complications. Vulnerable groups—young children, pregnant people, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals—are at substantially greater risk of severe outcomes from contaminated dairy.

## Making an informed choice

When evaluating potential raw milk benefits, weigh the limited and inconsistent evidence of improved nutrition or gut effects against the well-documented increase in foodborne illness risk. For those seeking probiotic or microbiome-supporting foods, fermented dairy products are a safer alternative. If considering microbiome-focused approaches, informational resources and testing (for example, product information such as <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">Microbiome Test product page</a>) can help clarify individualized options without exposing you to avoidable pathogens.

The balance of evidence favors pasteurized milk for broad safety, while recognized probiotic foods and evidence-based interventions remain preferable routes to support gut health without the documented risks of raw milk.
