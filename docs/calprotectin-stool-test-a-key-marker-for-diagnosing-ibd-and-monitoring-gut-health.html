## Introduction

A calprotectin stool test is a non-invasive laboratory assessment that measures levels of calprotectin, a protein released by white blood cells during intestinal inflammation. Measuring fecal calprotectin levels provides an objective indicator of gut inflammation and helps distinguish inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) from functional disorders that typically lack inflammatory markers.

## What is calprotectin and why it matters

Calprotectin is abundant in neutrophils and is released into the intestinal lumen when the mucosa is inflamed. Elevated fecal calprotectin levels correlate with neutrophil influx in the gut, making the test useful for detecting active inflammation related to conditions such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Because the test analyzes a stool sample, it is practical for repeated monitoring without invasive procedures.

## How the stool inflammation test works

The stool inflammation test involves collecting a small stool sample using a kit supplied by a clinic or testing service. The sample is sent to a laboratory where immunoassays quantify calprotectin concentration. Results are reported as micrograms of calprotectin per gram of stool, with reference ranges that vary slightly by laboratory. Tests performed over time can reveal trends in disease activity and treatment response.

## Role in IBD diagnosis and differential assessment

One of the test’s primary clinical uses is to support IBD diagnosis. Elevated fecal calprotectin levels suggest intestinal inflammation and can prompt further evaluation, while low levels make active IBD less likely and reduce the immediate need for invasive diagnostics. In clinical practice, calprotectin testing helps differentiate inflammatory conditions from disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which generally does not cause elevated calprotectin.

The test can be particularly informative when combined with clinical assessment, blood tests, and imaging studies.

## Monitoring Crohn’s disease and treatment response

For people with Crohn’s disease, serial fecal calprotectin measurements offer a quantitative way to monitor mucosal inflammation and detect subclinical activity. Rising levels may precede symptomatic flares, while decreasing levels often reflect effective therapy. Regular monitoring supports evidence-based adjustments to medical management and can reduce reliance on frequent endoscopy when combined with other clinical information.

## Benefits of early detection and ongoing surveillance

Early detection of intestinal inflammation enables timely therapeutic decisions that can reduce complications and improve long-term outcomes. Ongoing surveillance with fecal calprotectin helps clinicians evaluate treatment efficacy and identify relapse early, supporting personalized management strategies for people with IBD.

## Complementary microbiome insights

Microbiome analysis complements calprotectin-based inflammation assessment by characterizing the composition of gut bacteria and identifying patterns associated with dysbiosis. InnerBuddies offers a microbiome testing service that can provide such context; for information about microbiome-focused nutrition see <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/innerbuddies-personalized-gut-microbiome-nutrition">personalized gut microbiome nutrition</a> and explore links between diet and gut microbes at <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/gut-feeling-exploring-the-keto-diet">keto diet and gut health</a>.

## Conclusion

Fecal calprotectin is a practical, evidence-based biomarker for detecting and tracking intestinal inflammation. When used alongside clinical evaluation and microbiome insights, it enhances diagnostic accuracy and supports informed management of IBD and related conditions.
