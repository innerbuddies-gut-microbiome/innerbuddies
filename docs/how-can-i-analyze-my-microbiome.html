This guide summarizes common laboratory approaches, practical testing considerations, and how to interpret core metrics such as diversity and function. For a deeper walkthrough of methods and sample handling, see <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/how-can-i-analyze-my-microbiome">this guide to microbiome analysis</a>.</p>

<h2>Sequencing approaches: 16S and whole-genome shotgun</h2>
<p>Two sequencing approaches dominate microbiome profiling. 16S rRNA gene sequencing targets bacterial marker genes and is cost-effective for identifying bacterial genera and broad community shifts. Whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing reads all DNA in a sample and can resolve species, strains, and microbial functional potential, including contributions from fungi, viruses, and archaea. Choice of method depends on the question: community composition and relative changes are well addressed by 16S, while metabolic pathways and strain-level differences require WGS.</p>

<h2>Complementary gut health tests</h2>
<p>Sequencing identifies who is present; functional gut health tests evaluate what the gut is doing. Common assays include stool inflammation markers (e.g., calprotectin), digestive enzyme panels, short-chain fatty acid profiling, and intestinal permeability markers like zonulin. Combining microbial profiling with functional tests provides a more complete assessment of gut state and helps prioritize interventions in clinical or research contexts.</p>

<h2>Assessing microbial diversity</h2>
<p>Microbial diversity is a key ecological metric. Richness (number of taxa), evenness (relative abundances), and alpha/beta diversity indices describe within-sample complexity and between-sample differences. Lower diversity has been associated with several chronic conditions in population studies, though context matters: diversity alone is not diagnostic. Tracking diversity over time can help evaluate the effect of dietary changes, probiotics, or other interventions.</p>

<h2>Sample collection and quality control</h2>
<p>Accurate results depend on proper sample collection. Use sterile collection devices, avoid urine or toilet-water contamination, and follow instructions for preservatives or cold-chain handling if provided. Collect during a representative bowel movement (not during acute illness when possible). Many at-home kits exist; lab-grade preservatives stabilize DNA for transport, but prompt shipping and adherence to the kit protocol reduce technical variability. For examples of consumer-facing options, see a commonly used <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">microbiome test kit</a>.</p>

<h2>Interpreting results and next steps</h2>
<p>Reports typically present taxonomic profiles, diversity metrics, and inferred functions. Interpretation should consider clinical context, medication use (especially recent antibiotics), diet, and lifestyle. Where available, compare results to reference populations and focus on actionable patterns—such as loss of butyrate-producing taxa or overrepresentation of potential pathobionts—rather than single microbes. Follow-up testing can document response to dietary fiber, fermented foods, or clinically indicated treatments.</p>
