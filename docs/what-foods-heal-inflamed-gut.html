Dietary choices influence the microbial ecosystem in the gastrointestinal tract and can either perpetuate or reduce inflammation. This article summarizes evidence-based food strategies to support recovery and explains how microbiome data can guide personalized choices.</p>

<h2>Why testing helps identify trigger and healing foods</h2>

<p>Microbiome analysis offers a window into the balance of beneficial and potentially pro-inflammatory microbes, and whether important functions—like short-chain fatty acid production—are intact. For a general overview of how microbiome types differ, see <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/what-are-the-three-types-of-microbiome">the three microbiome types</a>. Targeted data can reveal susceptibilities to common triggers (e.g., gluten, dairy, high sugar) and support a more precise nutrition plan. For practical test options, informational resources such as the <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">InnerBuddies Microbiome Test</a> summarize how results translate to food guidance.</p>

<h2>Foods and patterns to avoid when the gut is inflamed</h2>

<p>Certain foods commonly correlate with increased gut irritation or dysbiosis: refined sugars and processed carbohydrates that encourage opportunistic microbes, industrial seed oils high in omega-6 fatty acids, ultra-processed products containing emulsifiers and artificial sweeteners, and excessive alcohol or caffeine. Individual sensitivities (for example to gluten, dairy, or high-FODMAP items) vary and are best confirmed through symptom tracking or microbiome-informed guidance.</p>

<h2>Evidence-based foods that support gut recovery</h2>

<p>1) Prebiotic fibers: Fermentable fibers feed beneficial bacteria and increase production of short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, which support mucosal integrity. Examples include chicory root, Jerusalem artichokes, leeks, asparagus, and green bananas. Introduce progressively to limit gas in sensitive individuals.</p>

<p>2) Fermented foods and probiotics: Foods like yogurt, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut supply live microbes that can help re-establish balance. Those with histamine sensitivity or severe inflammation should add these slowly and monitor tolerance. For focused reading on therapeutic strains, see literature on <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/bifidobacterium-infantis-a-natural-solution-for-ibs-relief-and-gut-inflammation">Bifidobacterium infantis and gut inflammation</a> and a concise overview at <a href="https://telegra.ph/Bifidobacterium-infantis-A-Natural-Solution-for-IBS-Relief-and-Gut-Inflammation-12-16">Bifidobacterium infantis overview</a>.</p>

<p>3) Whole, anti-inflammatory foods: Fatty fish (omega-3 sources), colorful fruits and vegetables (polyphenols and antioxidants), and anti-inflammatory herbs (turmeric, ginger) support immune regulation and mucosal repair.</p>

<p>4) Collagen- and amino acid–rich broths: Bone broth and gelatin-containing foods can provide substrates (e.g., glycine, glutamine) associated with mucosal repair and reduced permeability in some studies.</p>

<h2>Practical implementation and monitoring</h2>

<p>Adopt gradual changes: start with easily digestible, nutrient-dense meals, increase prebiotic fibers slowly, and introduce fermented foods in small amounts. Combine mindful eating (chewing well, relaxed meals) with symptom tracking to identify patterns. When available, integrate microbiome test results to prioritize the foods most likely to help your unique microbial profile and functional deficits.</p>

<p>Overall, emphasizing diverse plant foods, minimizing ultra-processed items, and using microbiome-informed guidance improves the probability of reducing gut inflammation over time.
