Resetting it involves restoring autonomic balance, reducing neuroinflammation, and improving resilience. Emerging research highlights the gut–brain axis as a central pathway for nervous system regulation: microbial metabolites, immune signaling, and vagal communication all influence brain function. Integrating microbiome insights with lifestyle and behavioral strategies creates a practical, evidence‑based approach to nervous system reset.</p>

<h2>Microbiome Testing as a Foundation</h2>
<p>Stool‑based microbiome testing can identify dysbiosis, loss of beneficial taxa, or overgrowths associated with inflammation and altered neurotransmitter production. Data from a test can guide targeted nutritional and probiotic choices to support neurotransmitter pathways (for example, microbes involved in serotonin and GABA production) and barrier integrity. For an overview of steps on how to reset the nervous system informed by gut data, see <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/how-to-reset-the-nervous-system">how to reset the nervous system</a>. For additional methodology on profiling gut flora, consult modern testing options in this guide: <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/modern-methods-to-test-your-gut-flora">modern methods to test your gut flora</a>.</p>

<h2>Regulating the Autonomic Nervous System</h2>
<p>Balancing sympathetic (fight‑or‑flight) and parasympathetic (rest‑and‑digest) tone supports both mental health and digestive function. Practices that improve vagal tone—slow diaphragmatic breathing, paced exhalations, and moderate aerobic activity—have measurable effects on heart rate variability and inflammatory markers. Microbial metabolites such as short‑chain fatty acids also interact with the vagus nerve; increasing fiber‑fermenting taxa through diet can therefore support autonomic regulation.</p>

<h2>Calming Techniques and Nutritional Support</h2>
<p>Evidence‑based strategies to reduce anxiety and promote calm include mindfulness meditation, slow breathing, and consistent sleep schedules. Nutritionally, emphasizing a diverse, fiber‑rich diet and fermented foods can enhance microbial diversity and neurotransmitter precursor availability. For dietary perspectives that intersect with gut health, review analyses such as <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/can-a-paleo-diet-heal-your-gut-insights-from-experts">Can a Paleo Diet Heal Your Gut?</a> and a related discussion: <a href="https://telegra.ph/Can-a-Paleo-Diet-Heal-Your-Gut-Insights-from-Experts-12-11">Can a Paleo Diet Heal Your Gut: Insights from Experts</a>.</p>

<h2>Detoxification and Reducing Neurotoxic Stressors</h2>
<p>Nervous system detox focuses on lowering chronic cortisol exposure, reducing systemic inflammation, and restoring gut barrier function. Testing can reveal the presence of microbes that produce endotoxins (for example, lipopolysaccharide‑rich taxa) or deficits in barrier‑supporting species. Interventions commonly recommended in the literature include eliminating individual food triggers, increasing anti‑inflammatory nutrients (omega‑3s, polyphenols), and ensuring adequate hydration and fiber to facilitate metabolic clearance. Neutral product resources such as the <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">InnerBuddies microbiome test</a> are examples of tools used to obtain personalized microbial data.</p>

<h2>Putting It Together</h2>
<p>A nervous system reset is most effective when it pairs objective microbiome data with behavioral interventions: autonomic regulation, dietary adjustments, and targeted supplementation where deficiencies are identified. Retesting every 3–6 months is a reasonable strategy to assess progress and refine measures. By addressing both gut ecology and lifestyle drivers of stress, individuals can move toward improved mood stability, clearer cognition, and more robust physiological resilience.</p>
