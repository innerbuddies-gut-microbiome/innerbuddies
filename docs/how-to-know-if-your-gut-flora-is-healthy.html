When this ecosystem becomes unbalanced—known as dysbiosis—people often experience a range of symptoms that extend beyond occasional indigestion. Recognizing signs of an unhealthy microbiome and using objective testing can guide corrective steps based on evidence rather than guesswork.</p>

<h2>Common signs of an unhealthy gut</h2>

<p>Digestive symptoms are usually the most direct indicators of microbial imbalance. Persistent or recurrent issues to watch for include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bloating and excess gas:</strong> Over-fermentation from dysbiotic bacteria can cause ongoing bloating and foul-smelling gas.</li>
  <li><strong>Altered bowel habits:</strong> Chronic diarrhea, constipation, or alternating stools may reflect impaired microbial digestion or inflammation.</li>
  <li><strong>Abdominal pain and cramping:</strong> Local inflammation or overgrowth of pathogenic species can trigger discomfort.</li>
  <li><strong>New food intolerances:</strong> Sensitivities that arise without clear cause may be linked to altered microbial processing of foods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Non-digestive symptoms can also indicate microbiome issues. Fatigue, frequent infections, skin conditions (acne, eczema), brain fog, mood changes, and disrupted sleep have been associated with microbial imbalances in observational studies. While these signs are not specific to dysbiosis, their persistence alongside GI complaints strengthens the likelihood of microbial involvement.</p>

<h2>What dysbiosis does physiologically</h2>

<p>In a balanced microbiome, diverse beneficial species support nutrient extraction, produce short-chain fatty acids that nourish colon cells, synthesize vitamins, and help regulate immune responses. Dysbiosis can reduce microbial diversity, lower production of beneficial metabolites, and allow opportunistic organisms to proliferate. These shifts can promote low-grade inflammation, impair nutrient absorption, and alter gut barrier function—mechanisms implicated in conditions ranging from irritable bowel syndrome to metabolic and autoimmune disorders.</p>

<h2>Testing and next steps</h2>

<p>Stool-based microbiome testing provides a data-driven view of microbial composition, diversity scores, and potential pathogen overgrowth. Interpreting these results alongside symptoms and clinical history helps prioritize interventions. For practical guidance on test selection and common pitfalls, resources about whether <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/does-health-insurance-cover-gut-microbiome-testing-what-to-know">health insurance covers gut microbiome testing</a> and lists of <a href="https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/top-10-gut-microbiome-test-mistakes">common test mistakes</a> can be useful. A concise checklist of testing errors is also available in a short guide: <a href="https://telegra.ph/Top-10-Mistakes-to-Avoid-When-Taking-a-Gut-Microbiome-Test-12-27">Top 10 mistakes to avoid when taking a gut microbiome test</a>.</p>

<p>For those seeking a focused explanation of how to interpret symptom patterns and test results together, see this overview of <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/how-to-know-if-your-gut-flora-is-healthy">how to know if your gut flora is healthy</a>. Some testing services also offer detailed reports and suggestions about dietary fiber, prebiotics, and targeted probiotic strains; a typical option is a lab-based <a href="https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test">microbiome testing kit</a>.</p>

<p>Addressing dysbiosis usually involves restoring dietary diversity (especially fermentable fibers), managing stress and sleep, cautious use of antibiotics, and, where appropriate, targeted supplementation guided by test results. Working with a clinician or a qualified practitioner helps align interventions with individual health status and evidence-based practices.</p>
