Maintaining gut health is important for digestion, immunity, and metabolic function. This guide describes how InnerBuddies' microbiome test kit works, from sample collection to interpreting results, in evidence-based terms so you can understand the process and practical implications.

### Understanding the microbiome and its impact

The gut microbiome is a diverse community of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes that influence nutrient absorption, immune responses, and aspects of mood and energy. Analyzing gut bacteria can reveal diversity, relative abundances and functional potential—information that helps identify imbalances associated with digestive symptoms or metabolic concerns.

### Why people use a microbiome analysis

Microbiome data provide a snapshot of microbial composition and inferred functions, such as short-chain fatty acid production or vitamin synthesis. These metrics are used in research and clinical settings to guide dietary adjustments, monitor interventions, and generate hypotheses about host–microbe interactions.

### Overview of the testing workflow

1. Registration and kit preparation: Register the sample kit per instructions and work on a clean surface. The kit contains a collection tube with stabilization buffer and clear directions.
2. Sample collection: Collect a stool specimen using the included tool, following timing and hygiene guidelines to reduce contamination.
3. Secure packaging and shipping: Seal the sample and use the prepaid packaging to send it to the laboratory promptly.
4. Laboratory processing: DNA extraction and sequencing are performed in accredited facilities. InnerBuddies uses ISO-certified labs and standardized sequencing protocols to maximize reproducibility and data quality.

### Sample handling and quality considerations

The stabilization buffer included in the collection tube preserves nucleic acids at ambient temperatures for extended periods, which supports accurate downstream analysis. Avoid contaminating the specimen with urine or water, and follow timing instructions—fresh samples generally yield the best-quality data.

### What happens in the lab

Laboratory workflows typically involve DNA extraction, amplification or library preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis. The output includes taxonomic profiles (which microbes are present and in what proportions) and functional inferences (what metabolic pathways are likely active).

### Receiving and interpreting results

Reports typically include diversity scores, abundances of beneficial and potentially harmful taxa, and functional highlights such as short-chain fatty acid production capacity. InnerBuddies summarizes these metrics and contextualizes them with dietary and lifestyle notes.

### Using results responsibly

Evidence-based recommendations often focus on dietary patterns, fiber diversity, and targeted adjustments rather than one-size-fits-all rules. Retesting after a period of consistent changes can document shifts in the microbiome.
