Intestinal permeability — commonly called "leaky gut" — refers to a compromised gut lining that allows larger molecules to pass into the bloodstream, potentially triggering immune responses and symptoms ranging from bloating to skin problems and mood changes.

Causes and common features

Multiple factors can contribute to increased intestinal permeability. Dietary elements such as excess sugar, highly processed foods, and alcohol may irritate the mucosa. Microbiome imbalance (dysbiosis) after antibiotics or poor diet can reduce beneficial bacteria that support the barrier. Chronic stress and systemic inflammation are also implicated in weakening tight junctions between epithelial cells. Typical symptoms include persistent bloating, food sensitivities, irregular bowel habits, skin rashes, and non-specific fatigue; these signs should prompt assessment rather than self-diagnosis.

Dietary and nutritional strategies

A food-first strategy aims to reduce irritants and supply substrates that support mucosal repair. Emphasize fiber-rich vegetables, omega-3 rich fatty fish, and fermented foods that provide live cultures. Nutrients and foods with supportive evidence include collagen-rich bone broth and sources of L-glutamine, which is a primary fuel for enterocytes. Avoid or limit refined sugars, artificial sweeteners, and highly processed items that can promote dysbiosis.

Microbiome support: prebiotics and probiotics

Supporting a diverse microbiome helps restore metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, that promote barrier integrity. Prebiotic fibers (e.g., inulin, resistant starch) feed beneficial bacteria, while probiotic-containing foods (kefir, sauerkraut, miso) or targeted probiotic strains have evidence for improving barrier function in some contexts. Recent meta-analyses suggest that select probiotic formulations can reduce markers of permeability, although effects are strain- and condition-specific.

Lifestyle interventions

Chronic stress and poor sleep negatively influence gut permeability through neuroendocrine and immune pathways. Mind-body practices such as meditation, regular moderate exercise, and prioritizing 7–9 hours of sleep can reduce stress-mediated impacts on the gut. Mindful eating — slowing down, chewing thoroughly, and reducing meal-time distractions — also supports efficient digestion and reduces symptom burden.

Supplements and herbal supports

Some supplements have research supporting their role in mucosal health: L-glutamine, zinc carnosine, and certain polyphenols may aid repair processes. Demulcent herbs like slippery elm and marshmallow root can provide symptomatic relief by coating the mucosa, and aloe vera has mild anti-inflammatory properties. Clinical guidance is recommended before starting supplements, particularly for people with complex or autoimmune conditions.

Integrating evidence and practical next steps

Healing intestinal permeability is typically gradual and individualized. Combining dietary adjustments, microbiome-supporting foods, stress reduction, and targeted supplementation yields the most consistent outcomes.
