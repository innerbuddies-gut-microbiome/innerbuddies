Gut microbiota (or gut flora) refers to the trillions of microorganisms — bacteria, viruses, archaea and fungi — that reside in the human digestive tract. These microbes collectively influence digestion, nutrient production, immune function, metabolism and even mood through the gut–brain axis. Microbial genes (the microbiome) vastly outnumber human genes, and microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate, butyrate) support colon health, regulate inflammation and contribute to energy metabolism.

Microbial diversity is a marker of resilience: people with higher gut diversity often show better metabolic and immune outcomes. Factors that shape the microbiota across life include mode of birth (vaginal vs. cesarean), breastfeeding, early antibiotic exposure, diet composition, environment (urban vs. rural) and physical activity. Diet is particularly influential because many microbes ferment non-digestible fibers into beneficial compounds; a fiber-rich, varied diet supports microbes that produce anti-inflammatory metabolites.

Imbalances in the gut community (dysbiosis) have been associated with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, allergies, metabolic disorders and mood disturbances, although causal links are still under investigation. Current research emphasizes correlation and mechanistic plausibility, with growing evidence from longitudinal and intervention studies.

Testing the gut microbiome (typically via stool analysis and sequencing methods like 16S rRNA or metagenomics) can provide a snapshot of microbial composition and potential functional capacity, which may guide dietary or lifestyle adjustments.
