Understanding the potential costs of diagnostic imaging is important when planning a gut health evaluation. Intestinal ultrasound is a non-invasive tool that complements microbiome testing by revealing structural or inflammatory changes that might relate to microbial imbalance. This article summarizes typical price ranges, factors that influence cost, and practical considerations for combining imaging with stool DNA testing.

## Typical price ranges and scope

On average in the United States, a targeted intestinal ultrasound commonly ranges from $250 to $600 when paid out-of-pocket. Broader gastrointestinal (GI) ultrasounds that assess multiple organs can cost more—often $400 to $1,200—because they require additional time, expertise, and interpretation. Abdominal ultrasounds used to evaluate liver, pancreas, and gallbladder typically fall around $200 to $500.

More advanced imaging (CT or MRI enterography) used for detailed bowel evaluation is substantially more expensive, often $500 to $2,000 depending on modality and facility. These higher-cost modalities are used selectively when ultrasound or clinical findings indicate complex pathology.

## Factors that affect cost

- Geographic location: urban centers and academic hospitals generally bill higher than community outpatient imaging centers.
- Facility type: hospital-based imaging often includes higher facility fees; independent diagnostic centers are typically less costly.
- Scope and complexity: single-organ ultrasounds are cheaper than full GI surveys or scans requiring contrast or guided procedures.
- Provider expertise: specialist interpretation (gastroenterology or abdominal radiology) can increase professional fees.
- Urgency and setting: same-day or emergency imaging commonly carries premium charges.

## Value in the context of microbiome testing

Imaging does not directly measure microbiota, but it offers structural and inflammatory context that can explain or validate findings from stool DNA sequencing. Coordinating stool-based microbiome tests with targeted imaging can help clinicians distinguish functional dysbiosis from structural disease such as strictures, inflammatory bowel disease, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) that may require different management.

Combining imaging and microbiome data can improve diagnostic accuracy, but the decision to image should be guided by clinical indications rather than routine use. If stool testing raises concerns (for example, patterns suggestive of malabsorption or inflammation), imaging is more likely to be clinically justified and covered by insurance.

## Practical tips to manage costs

- Ask for an itemized estimate and CPT codes to verify insurance coverage or preauthorization requirements.
- Consider outpatient imaging centers rather than hospital outpatient departments for lower facility fees.
- Coordinate timing with other tests to minimize repeat visits and redundant fees.
- Discuss whether a focused intestinal ultrasound is sufficient before pursuing higher-cost modalities.
