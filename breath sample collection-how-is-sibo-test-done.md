Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is diagnosed most commonly using non‑invasive breath testing that measures gases produced by microbial fermentation in the small intestine. This article summarizes what the test measures, differences between substrates, preparation and collection best practices, and how results are interpreted.

What the test measures

Breath tests quantify hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), and in some labs hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in exhaled air after a patient ingests a defined sugar substrate. Bacteria in the small intestine ferment that substrate and release gases that are absorbed into the bloodstream and exhaled. An early rise in gas levels implies fermentation in the small intestine (consistent with SIBO), whereas a later rise reflects normal colonic fermentation.

Lactulose vs glucose

Two common substrates are lactulose and glucose. Lactulose is non‑absorbable and can traverse the entire small bowel, offering greater sensitivity for distal overgrowth but lower specificity because rapid transit can mimic SIBO. Glucose is absorbed in the proximal small intestine, giving higher specificity for proximal SIBO but lower sensitivity for distal overgrowth. Choice depends on clinical suspicion and the specific diagnostic question.

Preparing for the test

Accurate results depend on careful preparation. Typical recommendations include a low‑residue or low‑FODMAP diet for 24–48 hours, an 8–12 hour fast before testing (water allowed), and stopping interfering medications when safe—antibiotics and many probiotics are usually withheld for 2–4 weeks. Patients should avoid smoking, gum, and vigorous exercise prior to testing and rinse the mouth with water (no toothpaste) before the baseline sample to reduce oral contamination.

Breath sample collection

Samples are collected at baseline and at regular intervals (commonly every 15–20 minutes) for 90–150 minutes depending on protocol. Collection can be direct into an analyzer or into sealed bags/tubes for laboratory analysis. Key points are full exhalation into the device, consistent timing, secure sealing of samples, and avoidance of environmental contamination. Home kits are available but require strict adherence to instructions to maintain sample integrity.

Interpreting results and next steps

Clinicians interpret gas rises relative to baseline and protocol thresholds (for example, a hydrogen rise ≥20 ppm within 90 minutes is a commonly used criterion; methane ≥10 ppm at any time is often considered significant). Results must be assessed alongside symptoms, medication history, and transit considerations. Hydrogen‑dominant SIBO often correlates with diarrhea and may respond to targeted antimicrobials; methane‑dominant patterns are associated with constipation and may require different regimens. Negative tests do not absolutely exclude SIBO—false negatives can occur after recent antibiotics or with distal overgrowth missed by glucose testing.

Complementary testing and follow‑up

Breath testing measures functional fermentation activity; stool‑based microbiome tests provide compositional context and can help guide longer‑term dietary and microbial management.
