Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) occurs when bacteria normally found in the colon multiply in the small intestine, disrupting digestion and nutrient absorption. Recognizing the pattern of symptoms and correlating them with targeted testing helps distinguish SIBO from other functional or inflammatory gut disorders.

Common gastrointestinal symptoms

- Persistent bloating shortly after meals (often within 30–60 minutes) caused by rapid fermentation of carbohydrates in the small intestine.
- Excessive gas, belching, or flatulence related to increased hydrogen or methane production by microbes.
- Abdominal pain or cramping, sometimes accompanied by visible distension.
- Altered bowel habits: diarrhea, constipation, or alternating stools. Methane producers (archaea) are frequently associated with constipation-dominant presentations, while hydrogen-producing bacteria more commonly produce loose stools.
- Early satiety, nausea, or a feeling of fullness after small amounts of food.

Signs of malabsorption and systemic effects

- Unexplained weight loss and fatigue, which can reflect poor absorption of calories and micronutrients.
- Nutrient deficiencies (B12, iron, fat-soluble vitamins) causing symptoms such as anemia, easy bruising, dry skin, or night-vision problems.
- Neurological complaints including brain fog, mood changes, or peripheral neuropathy can occur when bacterial metabolites (for example, D-lactic acid) accumulate or when nutrient deficiencies develop.

Clinical features that suggest deeper dysbiosis

- Marked abdominal distension that is visible and persistent, not just transient bloating.
- Fluctuating irritable bowel symptoms mislabelled as “IBS” without response to typical IBS strategies.
- Symptoms that worsen after specific carbohydrate-rich meals or following FODMAP intake, reflecting substrate-driven fermentation.

How testing clarifies symptoms

Breath tests (lactulose or glucose) measure hydrogen and methane produced by small intestinal bacteria after ingestion of a sugar substrate; a rapid rise in gases within 90 minutes supports SIBO. Elevated methane is associated with slowed motility and constipation, whereas hydrogen elevations align more with rapid fermentation and diarrhea. Stool- or DNA-based microbiome analyses provide complementary information about overall microbial diversity, presence of opportunistic species, and functional markers (e.g., short-chain fatty acid production) that influence symptom patterns.

Linking symptom patterns to evidence

Understanding which symptoms predominate helps interpret test results and plan management. For instance, predominant constipation with methane on breath testing suggests targeting methanogens, while diarrhea with hydrogen rises points toward hydrogen-producing bacteria. Identifying low levels of beneficial genera (for example, Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium) or reduced butyrate production on microbiome analysis can explain ongoing inflammation, permeability changes, or poor motility.

A microbiome report can contextualize symptoms and identify targets for clinical evaluation and tailored management; resources such as <a href='https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test'>Inner Buddies Microbiome Test</a> illustrate the type of data clinicians may use. Because SIBO symptoms overlap with other conditions, a combination of symptom pattern recognition and appropriate testing leads to more accurate diagnosis and informed care decisions.
