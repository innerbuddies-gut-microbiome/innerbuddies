As a spin-off from Maastricht University focused on science-driven innovation in the gut microbiome field, InnerBuddies collaborates with academic partners to translate research into practical insights for consumers and healthcare practitioners. Recently, InnerBuddies signed a data-sharing agreement with Aarhus University in Denmark to support research on the gut–brain axis and its potential influence on human behavior.

Dr. Sonja Perkovic, an associate professor at Aarhus University with a background in behavioral science, will lead analyses that explore relationships between the gut microbiome and decision-making. Her work combines behavioral research methods with public-health questions and has recently expanded to consider how microbial composition and function may relate to cognitive and affective processes relevant to choices in daily life.

Under the agreement, InnerBuddies will provide an anonymized dataset composed of microbiome composition (bacterial taxa and predicted bacterial functions) together with selected survey variables (sex, age, and responses to questions on stress and sleep) from customers who have opted in to scientific use of their data. The dataset will be shared only for the specified study, and all records will be removed or deleted at the conclusion of the research in accordance with EU GDPR regulations. These safeguards reflect standard practices for secondary-use microbiome data when individual identifiers are removed and use is constrained by a data-use agreement.

The collaboration aims to generate evidence-based insights rather than clinical directives. Analyses will focus on population-level associations and patterns that may suggest hypotheses for follow-up experimental or longitudinal work. Possible questions include whether variation in microbial taxa or functional potential correlates with reported stress levels or sleep patterns, and whether any observed microbial signatures are associated with measures of decision-making biases. Findings will be subject to peer review and published by the research team.

This partnership represents an example of academic–industry data sharing intended to advance understanding of microbiome–brain interactions while respecting participant consent and data protection standards. Future follow-up projects between InnerBuddies and Aarhus University may investigate causality and mechanisms using experimental or longitudinal designs if initial findings justify deeper inquiry.

Ethical oversight, transparent methodology, and reproducible reporting will be central to interpreting any observed associations between the gut microbiome and decision-making outcomes.
