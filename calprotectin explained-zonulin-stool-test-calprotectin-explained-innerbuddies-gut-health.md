# Stool Test Deep Dive: Zonulin, Calprotectin & Microbiome Explained

Gut health plays a central role in digestion, immunity and systemic wellness. Stool testing reveals biochemical and microbial signals from the intestinal environment that are not always apparent from symptoms or routine bloodwork. Two widely used stool markers—zonulin and calprotectin—offer specific insight into gut barrier function and intestinal inflammation.

InnerBuddies offers stool testing that maps these markers alongside broader microbiome data. For an overview of the zonulin and calprotectin tests within a clinical context, see this resource: [Zonulin Stool Test & Calprotectin Explained](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/zonulin-stool-test-calprotectin-explained-innerbuddies-gut-health).

## What stool markers reveal

Stool markers are measurable proteins, cells or metabolites shed into feces that reflect processes in the gastrointestinal tract. They help clinicians identify inflammation, infection, mucosal damage and permeability changes without invasive procedures. Interpreting multiple markers together provides a more accurate picture than any single result.

## Zonulin: marker of gut barrier permeability

Zonulin is a regulatory protein that modulates the tight junctions between intestinal epithelial cells. When zonulin expression rises, tight junctions loosen and intestinal permeability increases—a phenomenon often termed 'leaky gut.' Elevated zonulin in stool suggests that larger molecules and antigens may cross the barrier more readily, which can stimulate immune responses and contribute to food sensitivities or systemic inflammation.

Testing zonulin in stool gives a direct measure of barrier-related activity at the mucosal surface. Persistent elevation should prompt evaluation of potential triggers such as dysbiosis, certain dietary components, infections, or chronic stressors.

## Calprotectin: indicator of intestinal inflammation

Calprotectin is a protein released by neutrophils and other white blood cells during inflammation. When intestinal inflammation is present, calprotectin concentrations in feces rise markedly. The calprotectin stool test is commonly used to differentiate inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), like Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, from functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), where inflammation is typically absent.

Because calprotectin correlates with neutrophil activity, trends over time can track treatment response or disease activity without repeated endoscopy in many cases.

## Other useful stool inflammation tests

Beyond zonulin and calprotectin, clinicians may use assays for lactoferrin, fecal occult blood, pathogen panels and comprehensive microbiome sequencing. Each marker contributes unique information: lactoferrin also reflects neutrophil presence, fecal occult blood detects bleeding, and pathogen tests identify infectious drivers of inflammation.

## Using results to guide management

Stool test interpretations are most useful when combined with clinical context, diet history and other laboratory data. Programs like InnerBuddies integrate stool marker results with personalized recommendations for dietary adjustments, microbiome-supporting strategies and monitoring plans.

Clinical decisions should be evidence-based and individualized. Serial monitoring of zonulin and calprotectin can document improvement or persistent dysfunction and help refine interventions.

## Summary

Zonulin and calprotectin are complementary stool markers: zonulin informs about intestinal barrier permeability, and calprotectin indicates neutrophil-driven inflammation. Combined with other stool assays and clinical assessment, these markers support targeted strategies to restore gut barrier integrity and reduce intestinal inflammation.
