Clostridioides difficile — commonly called C. diff — is a spore-forming, Gram-positive bacterium that can cause anything from mild diarrhea to severe colitis and life-threatening complications. Its toxins (toxin A and toxin B) damage the colon lining and provoke inflammation. While many people carry C. diff asymptomatically, disruption of the gut microbiome — most often after antibiotic use — increases the risk of symptomatic infection.

## Key signs and clinical concerns

Typical symptoms include watery diarrhea (commonly defined as three or more loose stools per day), abdominal cramping, fever, nausea, and dehydration. In severe cases patients can develop toxic megacolon, sepsis, or bowel perforation. Because spores survive for long periods on surfaces, outbreaks in healthcare settings are a recognized hazard.

## Who is at increased risk

Older adults, hospitalized patients, those with recent or prolonged antibiotic exposure, people receiving chemotherapy or immunosuppressants, and individuals with inflammatory bowel disease have higher susceptibility. However, otherwise healthy people can also develop CDI (C. diff infection), particularly following broad‑spectrum antibiotics.

## How it spreads and how it is diagnosed

Transmission is primarily fecal–oral: contaminated hands, surfaces, or medical equipment transfer spores that are resistant to many routine disinfectants. Diagnosis relies on clinical context plus laboratory testing, typically stool assays that detect toxins or their genes (e.g., PCR). For complicated presentations, endoscopy or imaging may be used to assess severity and complications.

## Treatment approaches

First-line management depends on severity. Current evidence supports targeted antibiotics such as oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin for initial episodes; metronidazole is no longer preferred as primary therapy in many guidelines. Severe or fulminant disease may require higher-dose regimens or surgical consultation. Recurrent CDI is common (approximately 20–30% after an initial episode); options for recurrence include fecal microbiota transplantation under clinical guidance and adjunctive monoclonal antibodies like bezlotoxumab. Probiotics are sometimes used as supportive therapy but are not a substitute for evidence-based treatment.

## The role of the gut microbiome

A diverse and balanced microbiome resists colonization by pathogens and supports mucosal immunity and barrier function. Antibiotic-induced dysbiosis reduces colonization resistance and permits C. diff expansion. Restoration of microbial diversity — whether through diet, targeted prebiotics/probiotics, or clinical microbiome procedures — is an important component of preventing recurrence and promoting recovery.

## Prevention basics

Key preventive measures include judicious antibiotic prescribing, rigorous hand hygiene (soap and water is more effective than alcohol rubs for spores), thorough environmental cleaning with sporicidal agents in care settings, and attention to restoring microbiome diversity after antibiotics. Early recognition and evidence-based treatment reduce complications and limit transmission.
