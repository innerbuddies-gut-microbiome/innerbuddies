# 7 Science-Backed Steps to Strengthen Your Gut

Gut health influences digestion, immune function, mood, and energy. A diverse, balanced gut microbiome helps with nutrient absorption and protects against opportunistic microbes. Personalizing recommendations based on your microbiome composition can improve outcomes; see the [InnerBuddies Microbiome Test](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/7-science-backed-steps-to-improve-gut-health-with-innerbuddies) for an example of a test designed to reveal individual patterns. For general guidance, the following seven evidence-informed steps are widely supported in the literature.

## 1. Understand your gut microbiome

Knowing the composition of your gut community helps tailor dietary and lifestyle choices. Microbiome profiling can identify imbalances such as low diversity or an overrepresentation of particular taxa associated with metabolic or inflammatory patterns.

## 2. Eat a fiber-rich, varied diet

Dietary fiber is the primary fuel for many beneficial gut bacteria. Soluble and insoluble fibers support different microbes and physiological functions: soluble fiber is fermented into short-chain fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory effects, while insoluble fiber supports stool bulk and transit. Include fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds and increase fiber gradually to reduce discomfort.

## 3. Include fermented foods regularly

Fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut provide live microbes and substrates that can support community balance. Randomized and observational studies suggest fermented foods can modulate gut composition and function, though effects vary by food type and individual baseline microbiota.

## 4. Maintain adequate hydration

Water supports mucosal integrity and intestinal transit, which helps maintain a stable microbial environment. Adequate hydration also aids digestion and nutrient absorption. Habitual fluid intake contributes to regular stool consistency and lowers constipation risk.

## 5. Manage stress and support the gut–brain axis

Psychological stress alters gut motility, secretion, and immune signaling, which can shift microbial composition. Mindfulness practices, breathing exercises, and moderate behavioral interventions can reduce stress-related gut symptoms.

## 6. Stay physically active

Regular physical activity is associated with greater microbial diversity and improved gut transit. Both aerobic and resistance exercise have been linked to favorable shifts in microbiome composition and metabolic markers. Aim for consistent, moderate activity most days of the week.

## 7. Limit unnecessary antibiotics and processed foods

Antibiotics can reduce microbial diversity and perturb community structure; use them only when clinically indicated. Ultra-processed foods often contain additives and high levels of refined sugar and fat, which are associated with unfavorable microbial changes. Emphasize minimally processed whole foods.
