# Stool Sample Tips to Improve Accuracy: Secrets from Viome, Zoe & InnerBuddies Users

Accurate stool sample collection underpins reliable microbiome testing. The main goals are to minimize contamination, preserve nucleic acids, and represent your typical gut state. Protocols developed by testing services such as Viome and Zoe—along with user feedback from InnerBuddies kits—highlight practical steps that reduce pre-analytical error and improve downstream sequencing results.

## Understanding stool sample best practices

A useful stool sample captures the native diversity and relative abundance of microbes present at the time of collection. Common pre-analytical errors include sampling from toilet water, touching the specimen with bare hands, delayed sealing, and exposure to extreme temperatures. Any of these can alter microbial viability or DNA integrity and bias compositional or functional readouts.

Basic best practices: use only the provided collection tools, avoid contact between sample and external surfaces, seal containers promptly, and follow manufacturer instructions precisely. Consistency in how and when samples are collected also helps comparability across time points.

## Preparing for microbiome testing

Dietary and medication factors influence gut communities. Maintain a consistent diet for several days before sampling and avoid major dietary shifts. Antibiotics, probiotics, and some supplements can transiently change microbial composition; avoid them before testing if the protocol advises doing so. Collect samples at a consistent time of day when possible—many protocols recommend morning samples to limit diurnal variability.

## Insights from Viome: using the Viome stool cap

Viome’s collection system uses a stool cap designed to create an immediate seal and reduce oxygen exposure. Rapid sealing helps stabilize anaerobic taxa and limits post-collection shifts. Users report that careful handling—avoiding contact with the cap’s inner surfaces and ensuring a tight seal—reduces the risk of contamination and degradation during transit.

## Zoe gut sample tips for accurate results

Zoe emphasizes temperature control and immediate handling. If immediate shipment isn’t feasible, refrigeration can slow microbial metabolic activity and preserve community structure until transport. For longer delays, insulated packaging with cold packs (when supported by the provider) reduces temperature-driven changes during transit.

## InnerBuddies collection material and user advice

InnerBuddies kits prioritize ease and clarity of instructions to lower user error. Practical steps recommended by users include preparing a clean collection surface, using gloves, collecting immediately after a bowel movement for freshness, and sealing the sample without delay.

## Comparing methods and what to expect

Viome’s stool cap excels at rapid sealing, Zoe’s protocol stresses refrigeration and temperature control, and InnerBuddies focuses on user-friendly materials and clear instructions. Choice of method should reflect practical constraints: ability to refrigerate, shipping timelines, and comfort with the kit’s steps.

## After collection: handling and shipment

Store samples cool if immediate shipment is not possible and follow the lab’s shipping instructions. Track the shipment when available and note any deviations (temperature exposure, delays). Once received, labs typically proceed with DNA/RNA extraction and sequencing; pre-analytical quality directly influences the reliability of taxonomic and functional interpretations.
