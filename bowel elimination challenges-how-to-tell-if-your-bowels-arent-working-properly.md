# How to Tell If Your Bowels Aren't Working Properly?

Digestive function influences nutrition, immune function, mood, and energy. Subtle or intermittent symptoms can make it difficult to know when bowel function is impaired. This article outlines common signs of bowel dysfunction, how the gut microbiome contributes to symptoms, and how targeted testing can clarify underlying causes.

For a detailed overview, see [How to Tell If Your Bowels Aren't Working Properly?](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/how-to-tell-if-your-bowels-arent-working-properly).

## Common signs that warrant attention

Key physical indicators that your bowels may not be working properly include:

- Persistent bloating or abdominal distension after meals
- Recurrent or excessive gas despite dietary adjustments
- Irregular bowel movements (constipation, diarrhea, or alternating patterns)
- Undigested food particles in stool or changes in stool consistency
- Chronic fatigue or low energy linked with digestive complaints

Mood and cognitive changes are also relevant: the gut–brain axis means microbial shifts can affect neurotransmitter production and contribute to anxiety, low mood, or difficulty concentrating.

## How microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) shows up

The gut microbiome aids digestion, produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that support colon health, and suppresses pathogens. When diversity declines or specific groups overgrow, digestion and motility can be altered. Examples include:

- Excess methane-producing organisms associated with slower transit and constipation
- Higher proportions of Proteobacteria linked to diarrhea and inflammation
- Low levels of butyrate-producing species (e.g., Faecalibacterium) reducing mucosal support

These microbial patterns help explain why symptoms may switch between constipation and diarrhea or persist despite lifestyle changes.

## What testing can reveal

Stool-based microbiome analysis characterizes species abundance, diversity, and functional potential. Test results can identify overrepresented pathogens, deficiencies in beneficial taxa, and markers of inflammation or compromised barrier function. Such data can distinguish between likely microbial contributors and alternative causes (e.g., structural or metabolic disorders).

Optionally, tests that analyze stool composition and microbial genes (e.g., <a href='https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test'>gut microbiome testing</a>) can be employed in clinical evaluation to clarify suspected dysbiosis.

## Practical, evidence-based next steps

If you notice persistent or worsening symptoms, document patterns (timing, stool form, dietary triggers) and discuss them with a clinician. Where appropriate, targeted testing can provide data to support dietary adjustments (fiber diversity, fermentable substrates), microbiota-directed interventions, or further medical evaluation for conditions such as IBS, SIBO, or inflammatory bowel disease.

Recognizing bowel irregularities early and using objective data to guide interventions helps avoid normalization of symptoms that may be reversible with appropriate management.
