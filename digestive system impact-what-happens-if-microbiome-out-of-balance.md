<p>The human gut hosts a dense, diverse community of microorganisms that influence digestion, immunity, and metabolic health. When that community shifts away from a balanced state—a condition often called dysbiosis—multiple systems can be affected. This article summarizes common causes, typical signs, and how microbiome testing can clarify underlying changes.</p>

<h2>Causes and detection</h2>

<p>Microbiome imbalance frequently results from factors that reduce microbial diversity or favor opportunistic species: repeated antibiotic use, a low-fiber Western diet, chronic stress, poor sleep, and environmental exposures. Symptoms can be subtle or non-specific, which is why laboratory assessment is useful. Molecular sequencing of stool samples quantifies species abundance, diversity metrics, and functional markers such as short-chain fatty acid production or inflammation-associated taxa.</p>

<h2>Common signs of imbalance</h2>

<p>Local digestive symptoms often appear first: persistent bloating, gas, irregular stools (constipation or diarrhea), abdominal discomfort, and changes in appetite. Dysbiosis can also contribute to impaired nutrient absorption, increased intestinal permeability (sometimes called 'leaky gut'), and altered motility. Systemic or extraintestinal signs may include fatigue, skin conditions, food intolerances, and mood changes linked to microbial metabolites.</p>

<h2>Health risks associated with low diversity</h2>

<p>Microbial diversity is a resilience marker. Reduced diversity correlates in epidemiological studies with increased risk for metabolic disorders, certain autoimmune conditions, and inflammatory bowel diseases. While causality is complex and multifactorial, restoring a richer microbial ecosystem is generally associated with improved functional outcomes.</p>

<h2>Using testing to guide interventions</h2>

<p>Microbiome testing can identify overgrowths, low-abundance beneficial strains, and functional deficits (e.g., low butyrate production). An at-home laboratory option is available for those seeking data to inform dietary or therapeutic adjustments: <a href='https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test'>InnerBuddies microbiome test</a>. Data from testing support targeted strategies such as increasing diverse dietary fibers, introducing fermented foods, considering specific prebiotic/probiotic formulations, or pursuing clinical treatments when pathogens or overgrowths are detected.</p>

<h2>Practical steps to support recovery</h2>

<p>Evidence-based approaches emphasize whole-food, fiber-rich diets; reduced intake of refined sugars and processed foods; adequate sleep and stress management; and cautious, guided use of antibiotics. Monitoring over time with repeat testing helps assess whether interventions are improving diversity and function.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Dysbiosis can manifest across digestive and systemic domains. Laboratory assessment clarifies patterns that are not reliably inferred from symptoms alone. For a concise primer on the topic, see this summary: [What happens if my microbiome is out of balance?](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/what-happens-if-microbiome-out-of-balance). Careful interpretation and personalized plans—ideally developed with healthcare professionals—support safe, evidence-based recovery of microbial balance.</p>
