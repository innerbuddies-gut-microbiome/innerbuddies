Leaky gut (intestinal permeability) describes increased passage of substances from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream due to impaired barrier function. Emerging research links altered barrier integrity with inflammation, food sensitivities and disrupted immune responses. This article summarizes evidence-based, natural approaches to support barrier repair and healthy microbiome balance.

Causes and core mechanisms

Multiple factors can contribute to increased intestinal permeability. Common contributors include dietary triggers (high processed-sugar intake, excessive alcohol, and gluten in susceptible individuals), microbiome imbalance following antibiotic exposure, chronic psychological stress that elevates cortisol, and inflammatory or autoimmune processes. These factors can alter tight junction proteins between enterocytes and reduce mucosal defenses, permitting translocation of microbial products and larger food antigens.

Dietary strategies

Dietary modification is a foundational step. Emphasize whole, minimally processed foods, adequate fiber from diverse vegetables and legumes (when tolerated), and foods rich in omega-3s (fatty fish) to reduce inflammation. Fermented foods such as kefir and sauerkraut introduce live microbes that may help rebalance gut flora, while prebiotic sources (inulin-containing plants, resistant starches) support production of short-chain fatty acids that nourish colonocytes. Specific supporters of mucosal repair include collagen-rich bone broths and sufficient dietary protein to supply amino acids for tissue regeneration.

Probiotics, prebiotics and microbiome support

Restoring microbial balance can reduce factors that perpetuate permeability. Targeted probiotic strains have shown promise in modulating barrier function and reducing inflammation in some studies. Prebiotics feed beneficial microbes and promote production of short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyrate) that support epithelial health. If available, consider reviewing study data or personalized results; for example, published results from targeted ingredient-advice studies can provide context: <a href='https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/test-results-of-innerbuddies-personalized-ingredient-advice-v1-in-friends-family-study'>Test results of personalized ingredient advice</a>.

Supplements and botanical support

Selected supplements have mechanistic rationale for supporting barrier repair: L-glutamine serves as a preferred fuel for enterocytes, zinc (including zinc carnosine formulations) is involved in mucosal integrity, and certain demulcent herbs (slippery elm, marshmallow root) provide a protective coating that may reduce local irritation. Aloe vera has mild anti-inflammatory properties but should be used cautiously and under supervision. Evidence varies by compound and product quality; consult a clinician for individualized guidance.

Lifestyle and stress management

Stress reduction influences gut barrier function through neuroendocrine pathways. Practices that reduce chronic stress—consistent sleep, regular moderate exercise, mindfulness or yoga—can complement nutritional approaches. Mindful eating (slower meals, attention to hunger and fullness) also supports digestion and can reduce postprandial discomfort.

When to seek testing and professional care

If symptoms persist or are severe, structured evaluation (including assessment of diet, medications, microbiome disturbances and targeted tests) is appropriate. Resources on common dietary approaches such as the low-FODMAP strategy may help certain individuals with symptom-driven elimination; see a primer here: <a href='https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/the-fodmap-diet-a-beginners-guide'>The FODMAP diet: a beginner's guide</a>.
