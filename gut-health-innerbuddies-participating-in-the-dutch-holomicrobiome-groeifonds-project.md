The Netherlands’ Holomicrobiome Groeifonds initiative represents a large-scale public–private effort to map, model and apply microbiome science across humans, animals, plants and the environment. In March 2024 the Dutch cabinet allocated €200 million from the National Growth Fund to establish a consortium that integrates academic, research and industry partners to translate microbiome knowledge into sustainable applications.

The Holomicrobiome effort is structured around three core aims: enhancing health and environmental sustainability, fostering economic growth, and advancing scientific understanding of microbiome interactions. The programme brings together universities, university medical centres, research institutes and private companies to address cross-cutting questions about microbial communities and their functional roles. For an overview of the project and the consortium, see the Holomicrobiome Groeifonds project: [Holomicrobiome Groeifonds project](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/news/innerbuddies-participating-in-the-dutch-holomicrobiome-groeifonds-project).

Consortium composition and research focus
The consortium includes ten Dutch universities and five university medical centres, supported by organisations such as the Netherlands Institute of Ecology (NIOO-KNAW), KWR Water Research Institute and Wageningen Research. Private partners range from multinational food and biotech companies to technology startups. InnerBuddies is listed among participating private-sector partners and contributes domain expertise in personalized gut microbiome analysis.

Key unknowns targeted by the Holomicrobiome Institute
The institute aims to address a series of scientific and translational unknowns that span multiple ecosystems. Priority topics include:
- Microbiome interactions across ecosystems: mechanisms and pathways linking human, animal, plant and environmental microbiomes.
- Disease prevention and therapeutics: microbial community features that confer resilience to chronic or infectious disease and how interventions can be optimized.
- Antibiotic resistance dynamics: microbiome roles in the emergence, transmission and mitigation of resistance.
- Agriculture and sustainability: soil and plant microbiomes for crop resilience, carbon sequestration, and livestock health.
- Environmental applications: microbiome contributions to pollutant degradation, water quality and circular resource use.
- Personalized microbiome-based healthcare and diagnostics: longitudinal profiling and biomarker discovery.
- Biotechnological applications: microbiome-driven processes for bio-based products and industrial bioprocessing.
- Aging and microbiome trajectories: how microbial communities shift through life and influence age-related conditions.
- Ethics and regulation: social, legal and safety frameworks for microbiome interventions.

InnerBuddies’ role and related activities
InnerBuddies participates by integrating gut microbiome data analysis and personalized nutrition research with the project’s broader objectives. The company is also developing a spinoff focused on soil microbiomes, InnerSoils, which aligns with the programme’s agricultural and environmental workstreams. For methodological context and prior studies, see InnerBuddies’ published study results in the friends & family test cohort: <a href='https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/test-results-of-innerbuddies-personalized-ingredient-advice-v1-in-friends-family-study'>InnerBuddies test results study</a>, and an educational resource on dietary modulation of the microbiome: <a href='https://innerbuddies-gut-microbiome.github.io/innerbuddies/the-fodmap-diet-a-beginners-guide'>The FODMAP diet — a beginner’s guide</a>.

Research translation and governance
The programme’s multi-stakeholder structure aims to balance fundamental research with translational pathways while engaging ministries responsible for agriculture, nature, food quality and health. Outcomes are expected to inform sustainable agricultural practices, public health strategies and regulatory frameworks, without pre-empting specific commercial outcomes.

By coordinating cross-disciplinary expertise, the Holomicrobiome Groeifonds seeks evidence-based advances in microbiome science that can support health, environmental resilience and sustainable innovation.
