Introduction

The gut microbiome—the complex community of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes in the gastrointestinal tract—affects digestion, immunity, metabolism and even brain function. As microbiome testing becomes more accessible, patients increasingly ask: what kind of doctor interprets these results and prescribes targeted care?

Who interprets microbiome tests?

There is no single, universally recognized specialty titled “microbiome doctor.” Instead, several practitioner types commonly manage microbiome-related care: gastroenterologists, functional or integrative medicine physicians, registered dietitians with microbiome training, and clinicians who focus on microbial ecology and personalized nutrition. Each brings a different perspective: gastroenterologists emphasize pathology and standard diagnostics; functional practitioners prioritize root-cause analysis and lifestyle interventions.

Gastroenterologists and gut health specialists

Gastroenterologists are the primary medical specialists for digestive diseases and often incorporate stool sequencing and traditional tests into their evaluations of conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and persistent functional GI symptoms. Gut health specialists—who may include nurse practitioners and specialized dietitians—frequently collaborate on dietary strategies, supplement plans, and symptom management.

Microbiome-focused clinicians and microbial therapists

Functional medicine doctors and microbial therapists apply systems biology and personalized approaches to interpret microbiome data. They commonly use targeted probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, dietary modification, and behavioral strategies aimed at shifting community structure and metabolic output. Some practitioners also discuss advanced interventions such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in regulated clinical contexts, primarily for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection.

Emerging field: microbiome medicine

Microbiome medicine integrates microbiology, genomics, immunology and data science to translate complex sequencing outputs into actionable plans. Clinicians in this field may evaluate species abundance, functional pathways (e.g., short-chain fatty acid production), and metabolic markers. Evidence-based application requires careful interpretation: sequencing reports show associations and potential mechanisms, but clinical decisions should weigh symptoms, laboratory markers, and established guidelines.

Choosing the right provider

When deciding who to consult, consider credentials and clinical focus, experience with microbiome testing platforms, and whether the provider applies multidisciplinary care. Useful questions include: what tests do you use, how do you translate results into treatment, and which outcome measures do you follow? Reviews and case examples can help, but clinical transparency about limits of evidence is crucial.

Conclusion

Multiple clinician types work with microbiome data: gastroenterologists manage disease-focused care, while functional and integrative practitioners often emphasize personalized, microbiome-centered strategies. Selecting a provider who clearly communicates the strengths and limitations of microbiome testing and integrates clinical context will best support practical and safe care.
