## Which drink soothes the gut?

When digestive discomfort appears, beverages can either aggravate symptoms or provide measurable relief. A small set of drinks—bone broth, probiotic-fermented beverages, and certain herbal infusions—has the strongest evidence for reducing inflammation, supporting the mucosal barrier, and promoting a healthy microbiome. For a concise overview and practical guidance, see the detailed post: [Which drink soothes the gut?](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/which-drink-soothes-the-gut).

### Evidence-based options

- Bone broth: Rich in collagen, gelatin, glutamine and minerals, bone broth may support mucosal repair and intestinal barrier integrity. Animal and in vitro studies suggest collagen peptides can enhance tight junction function and reduce permeability; clinical evidence points to symptomatic benefit when broths are incorporated into a gut-healing diet.

- Fermented drinks (kefir and similar): Kefir contains diverse live bacterial and yeast strains that can increase microbial diversity and short-chain fatty acid production, especially butyrate, which nourishes colonocytes and modulates inflammation. Randomized and observational studies link regular consumption of fermented dairy to improved transit and reduced inflammation in some populations.

- Peppermint and chamomile: Peppermint oil acts as an antispasmodic via menthol-mediated relaxation of gut smooth muscle and has been shown to improve irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in trials. Chamomile contains flavonoids with anti-inflammatory and mild anxiolytic properties; experimental and clinical data support its role in easing dyspepsia and stress-related gut symptoms.

- Ginger and aloe vera: Ginger has prokinetic and antiemetic properties that can reduce nausea and improve gastric emptying. Aloe vera, when free of laxative anthraquinones, may soothe mucosal irritation and has been used in small clinical trials for certain inflammatory conditions.

### Practical considerations

Serving size and form matter. For example, 8–12 ounces of homemade or low-sodium bone broth daily may be enough to supply supportive amino acids; a 4–6 ounce serving of unsweetened kefir provides a concentrated dose of microbes. Steeping times influence herbal potency—steep peppermint 8–10 minutes and chamomile 10 minutes to extract active compounds. Individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease should use peppermint cautiously, as it can relax the lower esophageal sphincter.

Personalization improves outcomes. Microbiome composition influences how someone responds to probiotic foods or fermented drinks; a targeted analysis can clarify whether increasing specific genera or reducing pathobionts is a priority. For individualized insight, consider professional testing such as <a href='https://www.innerbuddies.com/products/microbiome-test'>gut microbiome testing</a> to inform beverage choices.

### Summary

A small portfolio of drinks—collagen-rich broths, fermented probiotic beverages, and certain herbal infusions—offers the most consistent evidence for gut-soothing effects. Choose forms and doses that match your symptoms and medical context, and use microbiome-informed data when available to tailor selections for the best outcomes.
