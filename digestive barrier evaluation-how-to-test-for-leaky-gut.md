Leaky gut (increased intestinal permeability) describes a compromised intestinal barrier that allows lumenal contents—bacterial products, antigens, and food fragments—to interact with the immune system. Accurate testing matters because permeability is a functional finding, not a standalone diagnosis. This concise guide reviews common tests, how microbiome data fit into the picture, and how clinicians combine results to form actionable conclusions.

Direct permeability assays and inflammatory biomarkers

- Lactulose-mannitol (L:M) test: A validated noninvasive urine test in which two non-metabolized sugars are ingested; the urinary lactulose-to-mannitol ratio indicates small intestinal paracellular permeability. It is useful for research and some clinical settings.
- Alternative markers: Polyethylene glycol fragments and fractional urinary excretion tests can probe permeability across different size thresholds.
- Inflammatory markers: Fecal calprotectin quantifies neutrophil-driven intestinal inflammation and helps distinguish inflammatory bowel disease from functional disorders. Serum markers like LPS-binding protein and zonulin are available; interpret zonulin cautiously because commercial assays differ in specificity.

Microbiome and metabolite testing: indirect but informative

Microbiome sequencing does not directly measure permeability, but it often reveals contributors to barrier dysfunction. Reduced microbial diversity and loss of butyrate-producing taxa (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Roseburia) correlate with lower short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and impaired epithelial support. Overrepresentation of Gram-negative pathobionts may increase LPS exposure and proinflammatory signaling.

Testing modalities:
- 16S rRNA sequencing: Genus-level profiles and diversity metrics; useful screening for dysbiosis.
- Shotgun metagenomics: Species resolution and functional gene profiling (SCFA synthesis, mucin degradation, LPS biosynthesis).
- Metabolomics (stool/serum): Quantifies SCFAs, bile acids, and tryptophan metabolites that directly affect barrier function.

Integrating tests for diagnosis

A robust evaluation combines symptom assessment, targeted labs, and microbiome/permeability data. Examples:
- Mildly elevated L:M ratio + low stool butyrate + dysbiosis suggests a functional, potentially reversible permeability issue responsive to dietary and microbiome-directed interventions.
- Markedly abnormal permeability + high fecal calprotectin + dysbiotic pattern may indicate an inflammatory process requiring gastroenterology work-up (e.g., endoscopy).

Other relevant assessments include stool pathogen panels, SIBO breath testing (hydrogen/methane), and basic blood work (CBC, CRP, metabolic panel, thyroid tests). Repeat testing over months helps monitor recovery and treatment response.

Applying microbiome findings to care

Microbiome results can guide targeted strategies: increase fermentable fibers and resistant starch to support butyrate producers, consider prebiotics or strain-specific probiotics when evidence supports benefit, and address identifiable overgrowths or pathogens with targeted therapies. Metabolite deficits (e.g., low butyrate) may prompt dietary shifts or supplementation. Always interpret results in clinical context and with follow-up biomarkers.
