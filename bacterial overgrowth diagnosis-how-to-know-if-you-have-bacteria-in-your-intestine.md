Intestinal bacteria are a normal and necessary part of digestion and immunity, but determining whether your gut bacteria are balanced or problematic requires attention to symptoms, markers, and testing. For a concise overview of signs and diagnostic options, see [How to know if you have bacteria in your intestine](https://www.innerbuddies.com/blogs/gut-health/how-to-know-if-you-have-bacteria-in-your-intestine).

Understanding what’s normal begins with recognizing the role of the gut microbiome: trillions of microbes aid nutrient absorption, produce metabolites like short-chain fatty acids, and contribute to immune defense. Dysbiosis—an unfavorable shift in microbial populations—can lead to bloating, gas, altered bowel habits, fatigue, skin issues, and mood changes. Acute bacterial infections (for example, Salmonella or C. difficile) present differently, typically with sudden severe diarrhea, fever, or bloody stools.

When to suspect imbalance versus infection

- Chronic or recurrent symptoms such as bloating after meals, persistent constipation or diarrhea, and unexplained fatigue often suggest dysbiosis or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).  
- Rapid onset of severe symptoms (high fever, intense abdominal pain, bloody stools, severe dehydration) suggests an infectious cause that warrants prompt medical evaluation.

Common diagnostic approaches

- Stool microbiome testing: DNA-based stool analysis (16S rRNA or shotgun metagenomics) provides a profile of bacterial species, diversity indices, and functional potential. These results can indicate low diversity, loss of beneficial taxa, or relative increases in opportunistic groups. You may also encounter biomarkers reported alongside community data.

- Breath testing for SIBO: Hydrogen/methane breath tests measure gases produced by small-intestine bacterial fermentation after ingesting a sugar substrate; early rises in hydrogen or methane support a SIBO diagnosis.

- Standard clinical tests: Stool cultures, PCR pathogen panels, and fecal calprotectin help distinguish inflammation or specific infections. Blood tests and nutrient panels can identify deficiencies (e.g., B12, iron) that suggest malabsorption.

Key intestinal health markers

- Calprotectin indicates intestinal inflammation and helps identify inflammatory bowel disease versus functional disorders.  
- Zonulin relates to intestinal permeability; elevated levels suggest increased gut leakiness.  
- Secretory IgA reflects mucosal immune status; abnormalities may indicate immune stress or dysregulated responses.

Practical next steps

- Track patterns: note timing, triggers, and duration of symptoms (post-meal bloating, nocturnal diarrhea, travel history, recent antibiotics).  
- Discuss targeted testing with a clinician if symptoms are persistent or severe. Combining symptom assessment with stool, breath, and biomarker testing yields the most actionable information.
