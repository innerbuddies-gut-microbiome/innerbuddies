# What to Eat to Restore the Gut?

Gut health underpins digestion, immunity, and even mood. After microbiome testing, dietary choices become a primary tool to restore balance, repair the intestinal lining, and encourage microbial diversity. This evidence-based overview outlines key foods and practical strategies to support gut recovery.

## Foundations: Feed the Microbiome and Repair the Lining

A resilient gut ecosystem depends on two complementary goals: provide substrates for beneficial microbes and supply nutrients that heal the mucosa. Prebiotic fibers (non-digestible carbohydrates) are fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as butyrate, which support epithelial health and reduce inflammation. At the same time, amino acids like glutamine and collagen components help regenerate tight junctions and mucosal cells.

Dietary focus should include a range of fiber types (soluble, insoluble, resistant starch) plus bioactive compounds (polyphenols) that selectively nourish beneficial strains.

## Key Foods to Prioritize

- Prebiotic-rich vegetables and fruits: onions, garlic, leeks, asparagus, green bananas, and chicory root provide inulin and oligosaccharides that feed Bifidobacteria and other commensals.
- Diverse whole-food fibers: legumes, oats, barley, apples, and cruciferous vegetables offer fermentable substrates and nutrients for SCFA production.
- Fermented foods: plain yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, and tempeh deliver live microbes and fermentation metabolites that can enhance colonization resistance.
- Omega-3 sources: fatty fish (salmon, sardines), flaxseed, and walnuts have anti-inflammatory effects relevant to gut integrity.
- Polyphenol-rich foods: berries, green tea, coffee, cocoa, and extra-virgin olive oil promote growth of beneficial microbes and act as antioxidants.
- Collagen and glutamine-containing foods: bone broth, well-cooked meats, and certain vegetables (spinach, beets) support epithelial repair.

## Foods and Substances to Limit

High intakes of refined sugars and ultra-processed foods can favour opportunistic microbes and reduce diversity. Excessive alcohol, artificial sweeteners (e.g., sucralose), and repeated unnecessary antibiotic exposure also disrupt microbial balance. For individuals with documented sensitivities, temporarily reducing reactive foods (e.g., gluten or specific FODMAPs) may decrease inflammation while healing progresses.

## Practical Approaches After Testing

Interpret microbiome results to identify deficits (for example, low Faecalibacterium or Bifidobacteria) and tailor food choices toward those taxa’s preferred substrates. Introduce fermented foods gradually if inflammation or sensitivity is present. Track symptoms alongside dietary changes and consider retesting after 8–12 weeks to confirm shifts in diversity.

## Summary

Restoring the gut combines nutrient-dense, fiber-rich whole foods with selective use of fermented foods, anti-inflammatory fats, and mucosal-supporting nutrients. Personalized testing can refine these choices; consistent, gradual dietary shifts typically produce measurable improvements in digestion, inflammation, and microbial diversity within weeks to months.
