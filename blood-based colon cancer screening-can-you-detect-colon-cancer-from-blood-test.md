Early detection of colorectal cancer improves outcomes, and blood-based tests are an active area of research and clinical development. This article summarizes the current science around blood biomarkers and how stool microbiome testing can complement non-invasive screening.

## How blood tests detect colorectal cancer

Tumors shed DNA, proteins, and extracellular material into the bloodstream. Modern assays analyze circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), methylation patterns (for example, methylated SEPT9), fragmentomics, proteins, and other signals. Multi-analyte approaches that combine DNA and protein markers use machine learning to increase sensitivity while trying to preserve specificity. Blood tests are attractive because they require only a routine blood draw, are repeatable for surveillance, and can be more acceptable than stool collection or invasive procedures.

However, sensitivity for early-stage cancers and for advanced precancerous lesions (advanced adenomas) remains variable across tests. Many blood assays detect a substantial fraction of cancers, but false negatives and false positives are concerns in population screening. For guideline-driven care, a positive non-invasive blood test typically requires diagnostic colonoscopy for confirmation and localization.

## Role of the gut microbiome

Gut microbial composition and function are associated with colorectal neoplasia. Certain organisms (for example, Fusobacterium nucleatum and toxin-producing Bacteroides fragilis) and functional shifts (bile acid metabolism, hydrogen sulfide production) correlate with cancer and adenomas. Stool sequencing—16S or whole-metagenome—can identify microbial signatures that distinguish cases from controls in research settings. Microbiome testing is promising as an adjunct risk signal but is influenced by diet, medication, geography, and technical factors, limiting its use as a standalone diagnostic.

Microbiome assays can complement blood tests: microbial risk profiles may prioritize individuals for more intensive surveillance or additional molecular testing, while blood-based ctDNA assays can provide circulating evidence of neoplasia. Integrative strategies aim to combine orthogonal signals to improve overall detection performance.

## Non-invasive alternatives and liquid biopsy

Stool DNA tests and high-sensitivity FIT remain proven non-invasive options with strong evidence for screening impact. Liquid biopsy (ctDNA and related analyses) is established in advanced disease and is rapidly maturing for minimal residual disease (MRD) detection and potentially early detection. Clinical utility depends on demonstrated impact on outcomes, clear follow-up pathways, and equitable validation across populations.

## Practical considerations

Key issues for implementation include analytic sensitivity for early lesions, maintaining high specificity to limit unnecessary colonoscopies, prospective validation across diverse cohorts, cost and reimbursement, and systems to ensure diagnostic follow-up. Patient counseling should clarify that current blood and microbiome tests are adjuncts to—not replacements for—established screening modalities.

## Conclusion

Blood-based assays and microbiome testing each offer complementary information. Combined, they hold promise to improve early detection and personalize screening, but currently they are best used alongside validated screening strategies and clinical judgment rather than as sole diagnostic tools.
