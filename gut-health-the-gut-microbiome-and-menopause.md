Menopause marks a major endocrine transition characterized by falling ovarian estrogen and progesterone. These hormonal changes affect more than reproductive tissues: they interact with the gut microbiome, the dense community of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microorganisms in the digestive tract. Emerging evidence suggests bidirectional influences between menopausal physiology and microbial composition, with implications for metabolism, bone health and mood.

Understanding the gut microbiome begins with its functions: digestion and fermentation of dietary fibers, production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), vitamin synthesis, immune modulation and xenobiotic metabolism. A specialized subset of bacteria termed the estrobolome contributes to estrogen metabolism via enzymes such as β-glucuronidase, which deconjugate estrogens and facilitate enterohepatic recirculation. Altered estrobolome activity can therefore change circulating estrogen availability and modify estrogen-dependent processes.

Menopausal transition is associated with measurable shifts in microbial diversity and composition. Studies report reduced alpha diversity in many postmenopausal cohorts and a shift toward taxa more commonly found in males. Specific observations include declines in SCFA-producing Firmicutes genera (for example, Ruminococcus) and relative increases in genera like Prevotella, Dorea and Sutterella. These compositional changes may promote low-grade inflammation, altered energy harvest and metabolic dysregulation.

Functional changes in the microbiome during menopause are notable. Reduced SCFA production can compromise gut barrier integrity and anti-inflammatory signaling. Changes in amino acid and phenolic compound degradation pathways—associated with increased Enterobacteriales in some studies—may further influence host metabolic pathways. Collectively, these microbial and functional shifts can contribute to health outcomes commonly reported after menopause, including changes in bone density, cardiometabolic risk and neurocognitive symptoms.

- Bone health: Microbiota can influence immune and endocrine pathways that regulate bone remodeling; dysbiosis has been linked to increased bone resorption in animal models and observational human studies.
- Cardiometabolic risk: Menopause-related microbial shifts correlate with inflammatory markers and lipid metabolism changes that may elevate cardiovascular risk.
- Mood and cognition: Through the gut–brain axis, microbiota-derived metabolites and immune mediators can affect neurotransmission and behavior, potentially contributing to mood variability and cognitive complaints.

Supporting gut health during and after the menopausal transition focuses on dietary and lifestyle measures shown to promote microbial diversity and beneficial functions. Emphasize a diverse, fiber-rich, plant-forward diet; include fermented or probiotic foods alongside prebiotic-rich plants (e.g., garlic, onions, asparagus); limit highly processed foods and added sugars; and maintain regular physical activity to support microbiome resilience.
